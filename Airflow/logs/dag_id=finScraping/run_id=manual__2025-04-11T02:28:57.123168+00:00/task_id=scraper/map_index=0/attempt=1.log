Two cannabis farms were also found, containing a total of 150 plants. Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as a result of on-going investigations.\n\nThe NCA estimates that £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques.\nCash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash.\nCrime gangs use them to enter cash into the financial system, mixing legitimate funds with criminal profits to hinder subsequent law enforcement investigations. They are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.\nThe crackdown, which is part of the NCA’s continued disruption of cash being laundered in the UK, involved 19 different police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.\n\nIt was supported by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and coordinated by the NCA’s National Economic Crime Centre, which provided intelligence to assist local forces, as well as funding for operational activity.\nRachael Herbert, Deputy Director of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said:\n“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country.\n“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.\n“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest impact offending in the UK.\n“Here at the National Economic Crime Centre, we coordinate UK-wide action, and lead cross-system efforts to make our financial system more resilient.\n“The excellent results from the first iteration of Operation Machinize are testament to the tireless work of officers across the country, and demonstrate our resolve to clamp down on organised criminality abusing the high street.”\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said:\n“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.\n“This successful NCA-led operation highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face and demonstrates our collective determination to make our streets safer, a key pillar of this government’s Plan for Change.\n“We will continue to support the NCA, and other law enforcement partners, as we make the UK an even more hostile environment for organised crime.”\n10 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1744286400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Preston man charged with assisting people smuggling kingpin', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/preston-man-charged-with-assisting-people-smuggling-kingpin', 'content': '\nA man from Preston has been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation into people smuggling.\nIranian national Anjan Ahmadi, age 26, of Stafano Road, Preston, was originally arrested in July 2024 as part of an enquiry into the activities of Amanj Hasan Zada.\nZada, also of Stefano Road, was convicted of a series of people smuggling offences in November 2024, when he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\nThe NCA were able to link him to a series of movements of migrants into the UK from France in late 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe he is part of the global people smuggling network moving migrants from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) into the UK and Europe.

But Verschueren invented the recipient to avoid checks during the first Covid lockdown and the hospital was in no way connected with the dry ice.\nUnder the dry ice were blocks of cocaine. The driver was arrested and later released without charge when it became clear he was an innocent dupe.\nVerschueren, of Sint-Katelijne-Waver, a municipality south of Antwerp, was convicted and jailed in Belgium for other drugs trafficking offences he committed in 2020 and 2021.

These are the first convictions for enabling a designated person.\nIn 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Dmitrii Ovsiannikov as governor of the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a position he held until July 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU, and when the UK left the EU, the UK imposed financial sanctions under the Russia Regulations 2019.\nAlthough sanctioned, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov secured a UK passport in January 2023 by virtue of having a British father.\xa0 Dmitrii arrived in Britain on 1 February 2023, and joined his wife and two young children\xa0who were already living in his brother's house in Clapham.\nThe same month, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov applied for a bank account into which his wife transferred £76,000, allowing him to put down a deposit on a Mercedes Benz GLC 300 SUV. However, the bank subsequently realised he was on the UK sanctions list and froze the account.\nDmitrii recovered his deposit, after which his brother Alexei Owsjanikow bought the car instead, and insured it for Dmitrii to drive.\nAt the time, Dmitrii was well aware he was subject to UK sanctions, having already applied to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office to have his designation lifted.\nDmitrii Ovsiannikov was arrested and interviewed in January 2024. Alexei Owsjanikow attended a voluntarily interview about his role in enabling sanctions evasion. Four months later, Alexei paid more than £40,000 in school fees for his brother's two youngest children, a breach of the sanctions.\nGraeme Biggar, Director General of the NCA said: “Dmitrii Ovsiannikov and his brother clearly knew that he was subject to these sanctions and deliberately took steps to circumvent the controls.\n“These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.\n“Today’s verdict is testament to the hard work and determination of the NCA’s Combatting Kleptocracy Cell, which has delivered more than 180 disruptions to remove or reduce a criminal threat posed by Putin-linked elites and their enablers since the invasion of Ukraine.”\nStephen Doughty, FCDO Sanctions Minister said:\xa0“Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions. Today’s verdict proves otherwise.\n“We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.\n“When this government came to office, we made clear we were committed to making sure sanctions were used most effectively – and crucially, robustly enforced.\n“We have been working tirelessly with colleagues across government to ensure our sanctions enforcement regime is both effective and efficient, and to give the right tools to our law enforcement agencies to be able to take robust action when necessary.”\nJulius Capon, Unit Head Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The sanctions regime was introduced against key individuals to encourage Russia to cease military action because it was hoped those with power will be hampered in their normal international business dealings.\n“Dmitrii Ovsyannikov was a high-profile official who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as the Governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia. He knew he had been on the UK sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this.\n“Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions and showed complete disregard for the law.\n“We hope this sends a clear message that the CPS and NCA investigators will work closely together to seek the convictions of sanction busters.\n“We will start proceeds of crime proceedings to get back illegally obtained cash and assets.”\n09 April 2025 ", 'date_time': 1744200000, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Venetic: Drug dealer caught with five kilos of cocaine found to have imported a further £17m worth', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-venetic-drug-dealer-caught-with-five-kilos-of-cocaine-found-to-have-imported-a-further-17m-worth', 'content': '\nA south London drug dealer convicted for supplying cocaine has been jailed after his seized encrypted phone showed he had imported more than half a tonne of the class A drug.\nKurtis Hoyte, 35, from Beckenham, was investigated\xa0by the\xa0Organised\xa0Crime Partnership (OCP) – a joint National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service unit.\nOCP officers arrested him in May 2020 after he was observed handing over five kilos of cocaine with an estimated street value of £180,000 to the driver of a flat-bed truck near\xa0Beckenham\xa0Hill Station.\nThey seized three phones from him, one of which was an encrypted EncroChat device.

He was identified by the NCA as being implicated in the smuggling of migrants of various nationalities into Greece.\n\nAnd earlier this year in January a Sudanese national was arrested in the north western city of Sabratha.

He’s alleged to have been part of a network involved in the large-scale smuggling of people in boats.\nIn both cases investigations into the wider criminal networks involved continue by the NCA and Libyan partners.\nAll four men now face prosecution by the Libyan Attorney General’s Office.\nThe arrests come as the NCA expands its international footprint to target people smuggling networks impacting the UK, through intelligence sharing and capacity building.\nNCA International Deputy Director Rick Jones said: \n“The fight against organised immigration crime is not limited to the English Channel. We are working to target, disrupt and dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate, in source countries and in transit countries.\n“To do that we need to co-operate with our international partners, and these arrests in Libya demonstrate that co-operation is bearing fruit.

Starkcake had the links to drugs suppliers overseas and those selling potentially fatal substances on UK streets. His messages revealed he was also a professional money launderer, managing and hiding millions of pounds he and others made from crime.”\nInvestigators found clues to Starkcake’s real-life identity in his messages, pairing these with cell site and financial data to verify it was Vaid.\nOne message to Starkcake indicated that criminal cash had been paid into the account of “H Vaid”, which investigators identified corresponded with a transaction on Vaid’s bank account. Officers also identified that Vaid made a payment at a café in Dubai around the time Starkcake told an associate he was in the country.\nInvestigators gathered cell site data that showed Vaid’s movements correlated with conversations about Starkcake’s whereabouts. In one case, data indicated Vaid was at a river near his then-home after Starkcake told an associate he was going for a riverside walk.\nInvestigators subsequently arrested Vaid at his home address in April 2024.\nThe evidence gathered by investigators was so compelling that Vaid pleaded guilty to 12 drugs and proceeds of crime charges, and a count of conspiracy to blackmail, relating to threats he made to a debtor.\nLead officer Seldon concluded: \n“Vaid attempted to fly under the radar by using an encrypted phone and getting others to do his bidding, but he underestimated the capability and tenacity of investigators.\n“By taking a pivotal person like Vaid out of the service of organised crime groups, the NCA is disrupting the supply of the most dangerous drugs in the UK and taking the profit out of ruining lives.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Man charged in NCA investigation over cocaine stash in electric wheelchair', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-charged-in-nca-investigation-over-cocaine-stash-in-electric-wheelchair', 'content': '\nA man has been charged with drug smuggling following a National Crime Agency investigation after nearly £1m of cocaine was found hidden in an electric wheelchair.\nCasimiro De Lemos Francisco, 56, was stopped at Manchester Airport on Sunday after he arrived on a flight from Bridgetown in Barbados.\nBorder Force officers scanned the wheelchair which contained 11 packages, weighing 12k, concealed in the seat and backrest.\nDe Lemos Francisco, a Portuguese national, was remanded today at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court and will appear next at Manchester Crown Court on 6 May.\n\nNCA senior investigating officer Charles Lee, said:\n“The concealment shows the ingenuity crime groups employ to smuggle cocaine.\n“The NCA works with partners at home and abroad to combat the threat of Class A drugs and protect the UK public.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Brothers jailed for 31 years for raping girls', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-brothers-jailed-for-31-years-for-raping-girls', 'content': '\nTwo brothers who raped vulnerable girls 18 years ago have been jailed for 31 years, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nMark Evans, 37, and Robert Evans, 40, abused children in Rotherham over a two-year period starting in 2006.\nToday [28 March] at Sheffield Crown Court they were sentenced to 14 and 17 years’ imprisonment respectively for their crimes.\nThe men, aged 18 and 21 around the time, intimidated girls and plied them with drugs and alcohol before luring them to locations where they attacked them.\nThe brothers were arrested in August 2020 after officers from the NCA’s Operation Stovewood, examining historic sexual abuse in Rotherham, investigated allegations made by three victims.Specially-trained NCA officers spoke with the women after identifying they were potentially victims.\nTwo of the women subsequently told specialist investigators they were raped by both brothers.\nOne of them was 13 at the time. She was given alcohol by Mark Evans before she and some friends accompanied him to a disused barn. He then separated her from her friends and raped her.The same woman was attacked by Robert Evans several months later, when he lured the girl to a house in Rotherham by lying that one of her friends would be there.\n\nPictured:\xa0Mark Evans (L) and Robert Evans (R)\nRobert Evans plied her with alcohol as they took a bus to the house. Once Evans had the victim alone at the house, he raped her. She recalled he seemed amused by this.\nAnother woman related how she too was raped by both brothers when she was 14. She knew the men because they spent time with other girls her age.She recounted how Mark Evans walked her home one evening because it was dark, but as they passed through an alleyway he raped her.\nShe and the first victim were later lured by Robert Evans to a house, on a separate occasion to when the first victim was attacked by him. At the house, Robert Evans forced the second girl into a bathroom and raped her.\nThe third victim was age 13 when Mark Evans began grooming her by giving her alcohol and drugs, and calling her his “girlfriend”. The victim told officers how Mark Evans visited her at her home and asked her for sex. Fearing Evans would dump her, the girl complied with his request, and he took her into an alleyway where he had sex with her.\nThese were just some of the sexual offences committed against the girls which the men denied when NCA investigators arrested them.\nHowever, following a two-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court the brothers were found guilty of a number of sexual offences, including rape, on 4 December 2024.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, NCA Senior Investigator Kim Boreham said: “I would like to recognise the courage and strength of the three victims in this case. For almost twenty years these women have suffered the profound consequences of Mark and Robert Evans’ crimes, while the two men continued their lives as normal.\n“These brave women have been determined to receive justice and the National Crime Agency has matched their resolve, ensuring the Evans brothers have been held to account.“I hope the victims will find some peace in knowing their attackers are no longer living free today.\n“I encourage anyone who was sexually abused as a child, no matter how long ago, to report it to police. Every victim deserves justice.”\nSamantha Thompson, Specialist Prosecutor, of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The Evans brothers targeted and groomed young girls including with alcohol and drugs,\xa0for child sexual abuse and rape.\n“The lifelong physical and emotional trauma caused to victims by men like the Evans brothers cannot be understated. This type of conduct has equally damaged the community confidence of Rotherham. \xa0\n“We would like to thank the victims\xa0in this case for coming forward and reporting this devastating crime. I hope this conviction sends a clear message that the CPS will continue to relentlessly pursue justice and prosecute those who sexually exploit children, whenever that abuse took place.\n“I encourage any victims of child sexual abuse and sexual violence to report the crimes committed against them to the police. You are not alone and there is always help available.”\nAdults can report sexual abuse suffered as a child by calling police on 101, or reporting it in person at a police station.

NCA analysts estimate that thousands of users – offenders and victims – based in the UK and other western countries have exchanged millions of messages online relating to sexual and physical abuse.\nAlthough adults are involved in these online communities, of particular concern is that offenders are predominantly teenage boys that often share sadistic and misogynistic material, and have been seen to target those their own age or younger.\nOffenders include a new generation of young, English-speaking cyber criminals who work together to execute data breaches and commit fraud, launch malware or ransomware attacks, and use social engineering and grooming techniques on victims.\nThe NCA and UK law enforcement have identified a number of cases in which girls, some as young as 11, have been coerced into seriously harming or sexually abusing themselves, siblings or pets.\nIn some instances, victims have been groomed into offending themselves.\nNCA Director General Graeme Biggar said:\n“This is a hugely complex and deeply concerning phenomenon. Young people are being drawn into these sadistic and violent online gangs where they are collaborating at scale to inflict, or incite others to commit, serious harm.\n“These groups are not lurking on the dark web, they exist in the same online world and platforms young people use on a daily basis. It is especially concerning to see the impact this is having on young girls who are often groomed into hurting themselves and in some cases, even encouraged to attempt suicide.\n“The NCA is coordinating UK law enforcement’s response to this emerging threat. We are collaborating with policing, tech companies, safeguarding agencies and psychologists to better understand how young people become offenders and safeguard victims.\n“Operating online clearly makes these offenders feel protected and out of reach but that is absolutely not the case. There have already been convictions, we and partners have made arrests in the UK and overseas, and further investigations are ongoing.\n“I’d encourage parents and carers to have regular conversations with their child about what they do online, and ensure they know they have your support should they need it.”\nThe online landscape of these networks is vast, with many groups having a different focus such as cybercrime or inflicting physical harm. However, membership is loose and fluid which leads to the range of different criminality being committed by individual offenders.\nLast month following an NCA investigation, Richard Ehiemere was convicted of fraud and indecent images of children (IIOC) offences, committed when he was just 17 and linked to a prolific online harms group.\nIn January, 19-year-old Cameron Finnigan was jailed for assisting suicide, possession of IIOC, a terror offence, and criminal damage, following an investigation by Counter Terror Policing South East (CTPSE).\nEvidence suggests that offenders are motivated by gaining notoriety and status, which can be achieved based on the harm they inflict and the depravity of the content they share. These networks share content relating to a broad and diverse range of extreme belief systems that they use to justify violence.\nSexual gratification can also be a motivating factor and in some cases, offenders are finding opportunities to profit from their criminality directly, or by selling material to others. The NCA is engaging with experts and academics to improve our understanding of motivations of offenders in this area and what can be done to deter them.\nAlso common across networks is the use of coercion and extortion tactics. Offenders manipulate victims by grooming them, or convincing them that they are in a relationship. As with other types of grooming, this leads to victims not recognising themselves as such, or being too scared to come forward, which likely contributes to the underreporting of this offending.\nJess Phillips, Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, said:\n“The scale of child sexual abuse in this report is absolutely horrific and drives home the need for a co-ordinated response to tackle this global issue.\n“We have seen the heartbreaking impact of crimes such as grooming and sextortion on victims around the world—many of them children who have been blackmailed and manipulated into sharing images of themselves, which has devastatingly led to some children taking their own lives.\n“This is why this government is using every lever at our disposal to make the UK a safer place for children online, including implementation of the Online Safety Act which has some of the strongest laws in the world to protect children.\n“My message to parents is to have open conversations with your children and to seek support if you are concerned about child sexual abuse.\n“My message to tech companies is simple: this is your responsibility too. You must ensure your platforms are safe for children, so that we can protect the most vulnerable and put predators behind bars.”\nAssistant Chief Constable Alastair Simpson, national policing lead for Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse & Undercover Online, said:\n“The growth of Com networks that incite and encourage children and vulnerable adults towards acts of self-harm, suicide and violence are hugely concerning.\n“The role of undercover online officers is vital in this space, and my message to anyone who is exploiting children online: remember that there is no space where criminals operate that we cannot go, and investigations into these networks have already begun.\n“Policing will always play its part, but social media providers have a clear role to play in monitoring and regulating their platforms to root out this abhorrent criminal behaviour and make all online spaces safe for children and adults.\n“I would encourage anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to report it to police, you will be met with empathy and respect, and there are organisations that can support you.”\nChildren and young people are better protected when they have adults around them who they feel they can trust, talk to and won’t be blamed by.

This could be a real photo taken by the victim, or a fake image created of them by the offender.\nNCA-commissioned research conducted prior to the campaign\'s launch showed that 74% of boys questioned did not fully understand what sextortion was, the same proportion\xa0didn\'t see requests for nude images as a warning sign or attempt of \'sextortion\',\xa073% were not aware of how to report incidents and only 12% admitted they may be at risk of \'sextortion\'.\n\'Sextortion\' can be perpetrated by organised crime groups based overseas, predominantly in some West African countries, but also South East Asia.\nThey are motivated by making money quickly, rather than by sexual gratification, and in some cases have gone from initial contact to blackmailing their victim in under an hour.\nAll age groups and genders have been targeted, but the month-long\xa0campaign is aimed at boys aged between 15 and 17.\nThe NCA\'s\xa0CEOP Safety Centre received 380 reports of \'sextortion\' in 2024 and in the first five months of 2024, police forces received an average of 117 reports of \'sextortion\' from under 18\'s each month. However, offences related to Child Sexual Abuse are generally underreported and the actual figure is likely to be higher.\nIn the year to June 2024, the US National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) received an average of 556 reports of \'sextortion\' per week, amounting to over 28,000 global cases per year – up from 26,718 the previous year.\nThe campaign follows an unprecedented alert issued by the NCA in April last year to teachers across the UK, which reached an estimated 320,000 - 365,000 people or roughly two thirds of all teaching staff.\nThese professionals reported that the alert had helped them recognise \'sextortion\', and made them better prepared if they should encounter any cases of it.\nAlongside this new campaign for teenage boys, the NCA is also issuing guidance for parents and carers on how to support their child if they become a victim.

It accounts for approximately 41% of all crime reports, and costs an estimated £6.8bn each year in England and Wales alone.\nEvery single UK police force and Regional Organised Crime Unit took part in the operation. They were joined by national agencies including the Financial Conduct Authority, National Crime Agency and National Trading Standards.\n\nIn Merseyside, more than £2.7 million in suspected criminal cash and assets was seized or forfeited, including £900,000-worth of high-value watches. The force also issued five account freezing orders totalling over £128,000. 12 suspects were interviewed as part of ongoing investigations into various fraud-related offences, and three others were charged.\nLeicestershire Police executed 18 warrants. 18 suspects were arrested and another two were interviewed voluntarily.

Three individuals have already been charged.\n\nSeveral National Crime Agency investigations, into high harm transnational frauds, all of which involve its Complex Financial Crime Teams, are ongoing.\nThe results represent a 91% increase on last year’s cash seizure figures, and 28% increase on last year’s cease and desist figures under Operation Henhouse. They show that through coordinated action, forces nationwide can tackle what is a complex and quickly evolving threat.\nNick Sharp, Deputy Director Fraud at the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) in the NCA, said:\n“This year’s Operation Henhouse results are a testament to the determination of officers and officials across the country to work together to tackle what can be a devastating and lifechanging crime.\n“The National Economic Crime Centre continues to work closely with law enforcement partners, the private sector and international counterparts to disrupt the highest harm organised crime groups who use technology to launch frauds on an industrial scale, often from overseas.”\nDetective Superintendent Oliver Little, from the Lead Force Operations Room at the City of London Police, said:\n“Henhouse is one of our most significant policing operations that we coordinate each year. As the National Lead Force for fraud, we have a responsibility to deliver impactful results across the UK, and we can't thank all the participating forces enough for their hard work and dedication throughout Henhouse 4.\n“Fraud can take many vindictive and harmful forms, but through the combined efforts of forces up and down the country, including those at the City of London Police, we can make a real difference in stopping criminals in their tracks. With over £7.5m seized and 433 arrests made during Henhouse 4, we will look to build on this success throughout the rest of 2025.”\nMinister for Fraud Lord Hanson said:\n“Fraud is a truly terrible crime which takes many forms and can affect anyone. We are determined to meet the scale of the issue head-on.\n“The ongoing success of Operation Henhouse demonstrates the excellence of police and law enforcement partners, and the real-world impact of their activity to crack down on this truly pernicious crime. We will continue to work closely with them to highlight the importance of the Stop! Think Fraud campaign, and to introduce a new expanded Fraud Strategy, as part of our Plan for Change.”\nThe public can take steps to help protect themselves. It is essential that they continue to report fraud to Action Fraud, and follow advice found on the Stop! Think Fraud website. Every report helps the NCA and policing identify and support victims, prevent future fraud, repatriate losses, and target the criminals, wherever they are.\n19 March 2025 ", 'date_time': 1742385600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': "Northamptonshire man threatened to send victim's indecent images to her family members", 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/northamptonshire-man-threatened-to-send-victims-indecent-images-to-her-family-members', 'content': '\nA man from Northamptonshire who blackmailed a child into sending him further indecent images by threatening to send them to her family and friends has been sentenced.\nKevin Newson, 43, from Daventry, was arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency after authorities in America were approached by a 16-year-old child. She said Newson had contacted her via online messaging platforms and asked her to send indecent images in late 2019 and early 2020.\nNewson told her he would send money for the images, sending a screenshot of his UK bank account.

As the offender\'s motive is to get money, once you have shown you can pay, they will likely ask for more and the blackmail may continue. If you have paid, don\'t panic, but don\'t pay anything more. Stop all communication with the offender and block them on any accounts you have been contacted on.\nYou are not to blame: A lot of victims feel responsible but this is absolutely not the case; you are not to blame and help and support is available.\nAvoid deleting anything: try not to delete anything that could be used as evidence such as messages, images and bank account details.\n\nAdvice for parents and carers:\n\nTalk to your child about FMSE: this will help to remove the stigma associated to this type of criminality. To support you, visit the CEOP Education website where there are a number of helpful resources.\nReport to the police: call 101 or 999 if there is an immediate risk of harm to your child.\nReport any images or videos that have been shared: if your child\'s image or video has been shared without their consent and they are under 18, help them to take the following 3 steps:\r\n\nReport Remove: a tool from Childline and the Internet Watch Foundation. Your child can use this to remove images that have been shared or might be shared.\nTake It Down: a tool from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Marchant, of no fixed abode, was next to him. Kelly, of Portway, Manchester, was in the accommodation area and Godfrey was asleep in a deck chair.\nThe Lily Lola was taken into Plymouth Royal Dockyard and the seized substances, which were divided into bales, removed and tested showing them to be high purity cocaine.\nA device that had been on board the Lily Lola was downloaded and some messages were recovered.

Byrne ordered Devlin to burn pallets that only contained bananas, and used as part of dummy runs, as they were unable to sell the fruit legitimately. There is reference to these dummy runs alone costing £300,000.\nByrne discussed the use of \'plug cars\' or vehicles with specially constructed hides to conceal drugs and money, and communicated with a handle called \'the plugboss\' who built these.\nByrne messaged another criminal associate to say that lorry drivers would be paid £50,000 each to smuggle 250 kilos of cocaine, but refused to reimburse their fuel costs.\nSome messages showed that he and Devlin paid £3 million for one particular load of 600 kilos of cocaine, which they would have sold at a higher price in the UK.\n\nImage of gold bars found on Matthew Byrnes phone\nByrne also traded in prohibited weapons and discussed buying Mac 11 submachine guns.\nHe supplied a contact called Jody Hall, who used the EncroChat handle \'unbeatenmoose\' and arranged for a third party known as \'The Boxer\' to inspect the firearms to confirm if they were a good investment.\nHall was arrested in July 2020 while collecting a firearm Byrne was selling via another contact, which turned out to be one which \'The Boxer\' had inspected.\nFurther messages from Byrne showed he was aware of Hall\'s arrest, discussing the type of police officers involved and the possibility of helping him escape by springing him from a prison van.\nHall, 51, of Carters Hill Close, Mottingham, Bromley, pleaded guilty to firearms and drugs offences and was jailed for 12 years in 2020.\nByrne and Devlin laundered their criminal profits through Chris O\'Shea, who owned a jeweller in Hatton Garden and used the EncroChat handle \'allstargin\'.\nBoth men exchanged cash with O\'Shea for clean money, gold bars and designer watches. Byrne laundered hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash at a time and bought gold for himself and others, including 10-15 at a price of around £40,000 per bar.\nHe tasked Devlin with transferring cash/gold to and from O\'Shea. Devlin personally requested £100,000 in clean, new, £20 notes, for which he agreed to pay O\'Shea 3% commission.\nO\'Shea, 56, of Avery Hill Road, New Eltham, pleaded guilty to money laundering and drugs offences in January 2024 and was jailed for 11 years.\n\nImage of firearms and silencers sent by Matthew Byrne to criminal contacts\nOCP officers arrested Byrne and Devlin in October 2020. At Byrne\'s address they seized £20,000 in cash from a bedside drawer, correspondence showing large amounts of cash in bank accounts, designer clothing, a brand new Jaguar car and an EncroChat phone. It was also noted that he was building a house next door.\nByrne\'s girlfriend\'s address was also searched, where officers had to break through an expensive reinforced door. They found various other items showing signs of wealth inside the house, such as designer clothing and leaflets for villas for sale in Portugal. A taser and correspondence in Devlin\'s name were found when they searched Byrne\'s parents\' home.\nDevlin\'s then address in Weald Road, Sevenoaks, was also searched. Officers found CS spray, a surveillance bug detecting kit, around £5,000 in cash and a large number of designer items such as shoes, clothing and jewellery.\nThe NCA\'s investigation formed part of Operation Venetic, the UK NCA-led law enforcement response to the takedown of the EncroChat service in June 2020.\nByrne and Devlin pleaded guilty to drugs and money laundering offences at Maidstone Crown Court on 9 January this year. Firearms charges against Byrne will lie on file.\nAt the same court today (7 March), Byrne was sentenced to 21-and-a-half years imprisonment and Devlin to 17 years imprisonment.\nAndrew Tickner, NCA Operations Manager from the OCP, said: \n"Matthew Byrne and Beau Devlin were at the pinnacle of this highly sophisticated and organised criminal group.\n"They were responsible for flooding the UK\'s streets with enormous quantities of cocaine via their contacts for onward sale, laundering the profits via gold and expensive watches.\n"They were across every stage of the drugs\' journey from South America, going to the trouble of organising dummy runs in an attempt to trick law enforcement into believing that they were running a legitimate business.\n"Although Byrne\'s firearms venture would have made him a useful contact to those in the criminal underworld, it\'s chilling to think about the violence and intimidation these weapons would have unleashed.

The warning was issued following a huge increase in arrests and seizures.\nLast year 26,924kg of cannabis was seized from around 750 smugglers flying into UK airports. This quantity is nearly five times more than the 5,609kg of cannabis seized for the whole of 2023, when 134 suspects were arrested.\n\nThe 2024 total is an exponential increase on the two tonnes of cannabis seized in 2022.\nIn 2024, 430 suspects were arrested at Heathrow Airport where 14,617kg of cannabis was seized.\nThe next worst affected airports were Manchester Airport, where around 135 arrests were made and 4,815kg of cannabis seized, and Birmingham Airport, where 40 arrests were made and 1,410kg cannabis seized.\nOf the suspects, 460 were arrested having arrived from Thailand; 108 arriving from Canada and 63 arriving from the USA. The remainder had flown in from a variety of other countries.\nBy national breakdown, around 290 UK citizens, 162 Malaysians, 86 Canadians and 52 Americans were arrested on suspicion of smuggling cannabis into the UK on commercial flights.\nThe NCA judges that the trend is being fuelled by organised crime groups that have access to cannabis grown overseas in locations where it is legal, and recruiting couriers to transport it to the UK where it can generate greater profit for them.\nAlex Murray, NCA Director of threat leadership, said:\n“Border Force have been excellent in detecting these couriers at the border, after which the NCA takes on the investigation. The NCA continues to work with law enforcement partners in both the UK, and overseas to target high-risk routes, seize shipments of drugs and disrupt the criminal gangs involved, denying them profits. We have been working well with the Thai authorities who are also keen to intervene.\n“Organised crime groups make significant profits by trafficking and selling perceived high-quality cannabis legally grown in the USA, Canada and Thailand illegally in the UK.\n“Couriers run the risk of a potentially life-changing prison sentence. Our targeting of them is crucial to breaking the supply chain.\n“We reissue our appeal to anyone who is asked to smuggle cannabis to think very carefully about the potential consequences of their actions, and the risks they run. Organised criminals can be persuasive and offer to pay smugglers. But as the numbers show, the risk of getting caught is very high, and simply isn’t worth it.”\n\nDanny Hewitt, Director of National Operational Headquarters for Border Force said: \n"Drugs have devastating impacts and ruin lives, which is why we are working tirelessly to prevent criminals from smuggling drugs across the border and ensure they face the full force of the law.\n“We continue to work closely with the NCA to break drug supply chains and keep our streets safe from harmful substances.”\nPotential couriers should be aware that the sentence for cannabis importation in the UK is up to 14 years in prison.\nIn 2024, at least 414 people were convicted of smuggling cannabis via UK airports.\nPassengers were most often found to be carrying between 15 and 40 kilos of cannabis inside their checked-in luggage.\nIn one case last year, however, Spanish national Fernando Mayans Fuster, 51, was caught at Manchester Airport with eight suitcases containing 158 kilos of the drug, after arriving on a flight from Los Angeles. This is believed to be one of the largest passenger seizures of its kind at Manchester Airport. Mayans Fuster was jailed for three years and four months.\nOn 9 August, 11 British passengers were arrested at Birmingham Airport after a total of 510 kilos of cannabis was found inside 28 suitcases. All the passengers had travelled from Thailand, transiting at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Their cases are believed to be linked.\nIn some instances, officers have recovered electronic trackers with the drugs, believed to have been placed in there by organised criminals at source so they could follow the illicit loads.\nAnyone with information on the smuggling of drugs through UK ports is urged to report it, anonymously if they prefer, by calling Border Force’s Customs Hotline on 0800 595 000.\n6 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741262400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Two men jailed for almost 40 years for raping girls at parties', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-two-men-jailed-for-almost-40-years-for-raping-girls-at-parties', 'content': "\nTwo men who got children drunk and then abused them at parties have been jailed for 38 and a half years in total, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nRomauld Stefan Houphouet, 37, an Ivoirian national of Sheffield, and Absolom Sigiyo, 42, a Zimbabwean national of Rotherham were found guilty of raping two 15-year-old girls countless times between 2011 and 2012, at Sheffield Crown Court on 3 March.\nSigiyo was also found guilty of intimidating one of the victims when he pressured her in an attempt to stop her supporting the NCA investigation launched in 2018.\nHouphouet has been sentenced to 20 years in prison and Sigiyo has been jailed for 18 years and six months.\nThe judge ordered that both men would be subject to restraint orders, to prevent them contacting the victims, and that they must sign the Sexual Offences Register.The victims told investigators they were taken to numerous parties in Rotherham where they were given alcohol and abused by the men, some of whom openly referred to them as “fresh meat”.\nThe abuse began within minutes of the victims’ first encounter with Houphouet in 2011. Then aged 24, Houphouet, approached the girls in Rotherham Town Centre and invited them to a party. He asked to speak alone with one of the girls and took her into an alleyway, where he raped her.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nPictured:\xa0Absolom Sigiyo (left) and\xa0Romauld Houphouet (right)\nAfter the attack, Houphouet took the girls to a house party at Sigiyo’s home where there were a number of men, including Sigiyo and Brzozowski. The girls endured a year of sexual abuse in this location\xa0and at a second property Sigiyo later lived at.\nOne victim recalled how Houphouet asked her to perform a lap dance for him at the first party. She and her friend were given alcohol, after which she was sick in the bathroom. When she came out of the room, Houphouet took her into a bedroom and raped her for the second time that evening.\nFrom this day on, the men regularly found the girls in the town centre and pressured them to go to Sigiyo’s home.\nThe victims described having chaotic lives and living in a care home from which they wanted to escape. Both men took advantage of the girls’ vulnerability, grooming and exploiting them. Sigiyo paid for taxis to his place and gave them cigarettes and alcohol. Once the girls had accepted these offerings, Sigiyo and Houphouet demanded the girls give them sex in return.\nSigiyo and Houphouet raped the girls multiple times. The second victim described being raped two to three times a week by Sigiyo, and on one occasion woke up to find him attempting to rape her.The first victim told NCA investigators how Houphouet was possessive of her. She related how on one occasion Houphouet verbally abused and raped her in an act of revenge, after finding his lodger Jacek Brzozowski \xa0having sex with her at one of the parties.\xa0\nThe girl was also raped by Sigiyo.\nSpecially trained officers from Operation Stovewood – the NCA’s investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse in Rotherham – contacted the women, who are both now in their 20s, after identifying they were potentially victims. The women subsequently told officers about the abuse.While under investigation for rape, Sigiyo approached one of the women on the street and pressured her to tell police he was innocent. But the woman instead reported what he had done, and NCA officers further arrested Sigiyo on suspicion of intimidation. Sigiyo was charged with this and numerous sexual offences and Houphouet and Brzozowski were charged with sexual offences in November 2022.Senior Investigating Officer Kath Blain said:\xa0“Words can barely describe the bravery these two women have shown in reporting what happened to them. It cannot have been easy for the women to have relived the terrible abuse they suffered but they did so with strength, courage and utmost dignity.\n“I’m so pleased that the National Crime Agency and its partners have secured justice for both women. Sigiyo and Houphouet are now facing the consequences of their horrendous crimes against two vulnerable girls.\xa0“I really hope this case gives other survivors of child abuse the confidence to report what has happened to them.”Sexual abuse can be reported to police in person or by calling 101. Police officers specially trained to investigate such cases are ready and waiting to help victims.\nMartin McRobb, Specialist Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said:\xa0“These defendants preyed on vulnerable young girls who they knew they could groom with alcohol and gifts with the sole aim of repeatedly sexually exploiting them.\n“The victims in this case are now adults but they have had to live with the trauma caused by the vile and serious sexual offences committed against them in their youth.\n“We know it can be difficult to talk about such abuse, and I would like to extend my thanks to the victims for the courage and fortitude they showed in coming forward and giving evidence against these men.\n“The Crown Prosecution Service will continue to work closely with law enforcement partners to support all victims of child sexual abuse as we relentlessly pursue justice on their behalf.”Jacek Brzozowski 35, a Polish national of Rotherham, will be sentenced for sexual activity with one of the girls at Sheffield Crown Court on 14 April.\nThe NCA's Operation Stovewood remains the single biggest investigation of its kind, looking at allegations of abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

Last year more than 70 people died attempting to cross the Channel by small boat, so tackling the criminal networks involved remains a priority for the NCA, both domestically and internationally.\nSCPOs are another tactic available to target, disrupt and dismantle people smuggling networks with a footprint in the UK.\n\nDoksani, Nguyen & Styles\nThis publication of SCPOs include Eglantin Doksani, who was made subject of an SCPO for his role in facilitating the movement of hundreds of migrants into the United Kingdom using small boats over the Channel. Doksani was sentenced to nine years and nine months in prison in July 2024, and was given a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order which will become live upon release from prison.\nDoksani acted as an agent for migrants and arranged spaces on boats. He was in direct contact with people smugglers operating in Europe and NCA investigators identified him as an associate of Hewa Rahimpur, a leader of a gang involved in moving 10,000 people to the UK. Doksani had used a fraudulent passport to open bank accounts to deposit his criminal profits.\nHis order includes restrictions around his communication devices, possession of money and bank accounts, notification of finances and assets, notification of travel outside the United Kingdom and prohibition on the possession of official documentation - preventing him from being in possession of official identity documents that do not belong to him or family members or for anyone not residing in the same address.\nAs part of the order he will also have to give the NCA notification of his residence.\nPeople smuggler Mai Van Nguyen was also made subject of a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order after he was convicted for his role in the movement of Vietnamese illegal migrants into the United Kingdom in the backs of lorries.\nHe was jailed for that offence for five-and-a-half years in November 2023, and on 24 February 2025, a jury found him guilty of further charges relating to exploitation of migrants being made to work in cannabis farms run by his gang.\nNguyen worked and was involved in multiple crossings for Vietnamese nationals, playing a key role in meeting the migrants on their arrival into the UK.\nHe facilitated the movement of migrants to safe houses operated by his organised crime group in the West Midlands and collected payments from the people he helped to smuggle. Some of those he helped bring to the UK are believed to have ended up working in cannabis factories.\nHis order includes restrictions round communication devices, possession of cash, notification of finances and assets, and notification of premises both within and outside the UK.\nRichard Styles was also made subject of a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order after being jailed for seven years for his role in a plot to smuggle four Albanians into the United Kingdom by flying them to an airfield in Northamptonshire.\nStyles was a qualified pilot who flew to Belgium to meet an associate and then flew the four migrants into the United Kingdom. He was arrested upon landing the plane and convicted of facilitating a breach of immigration law.\nHis order includes restrictions around communication devices, prohibition of private aircraft, restriction on travel and travel documents, prohibition on importations and notification requirements of entry to airports or airfields or the boundaries of an airport or airfield.\nAlison Abbott, Head of the NCA’s Prison and Lifetime Management Unit, said:\n“Offenders involved in organised crime groups so often think they can return to their criminal ventures once they are released from prison. But making them subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders mean we will continue to monitor their activity and prevent them from engaging in further criminality.\n“These men were key players in organised immigration crime and their SCPOs mean they will be less attractive for recruitment to criminal groups, and even communicating with them will be risky.\n“Organised immigration crime remains a priority for the NCA and these orders show we will use all powers available to us to dismantle criminal gangs and prevent further harm to the people they exploit.\n”Orders are enforced by the NCA and action is taken against offenders who breach the terms of their orders."\nThe publication of orders is considered carefully and on a case by case basis. Those judged to meet the right criteria appear on the NCA website. Publishing data on criminals who are subject to these orders enables other organisations and the public to report breaches.\nAnyone with relevant information on the individuals named should contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.\n3 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741003200, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'NCA warning over money laundering linked to people smuggling', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/nca-warning-over-money-laundering-linked-to-people-smuggling', 'content': '\nNational Crime Agency officers have warned registered Hawaladars in the UK of the consequences of being involved in organised immigration crime.\nHawaladar systems serve entirely legitimate purposes, but are known to be exploited by criminals looking to move criminal cash, including from small boat people smuggling activity.Visits to 44 businesses across the UK were delivered by the NCA, in coordination with HMRC, over the course of two days, 25 and 26 February. They were also attended by officers from 9 forces – a show of joint commitment to increase intelligence on financial flows linked to those who facilitate and enable people smuggling.Hawala is a type of informal value transfer system that operates on a basis of transfer of value without actual movement of money. It relies heavily on trust – between hawaladars and their customers, and within the networks themselves.These systems are used for a wide variety of reasons – such as cheaper or faster money transmission, cultural preference, lack of confidence in banks, or because they are the only channel through which funds can be transmitted in certain conflict regions.In the UK, they are subject to regulations and standards. They must be compliant with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations, and are legally required to report anything suspicious to the NCA.Those who do not do so risk criminal charges, heavy fines, business closures and severe reputational damage. Those who take payment from people smuggling activity, whether willingly or unwittingly, are helping to fuel a crime that endangers the lives of thousands.Last year, following a National Crime Agency investigation, Iranian hawaladar Asghar Gheshalghian was sentenced to eight years in jail after being convicted of running an unregistered money services business that served people smuggling networks.Gheshalghian acted as a trusted middleman, accepting payments from migrants or their families, and then releasing money to the criminal gangs following the completion of their journeys to the UK, charging a commission at the same time.This week’s activity was designed to emphasise the importance of vigilance, signpost reporting mechanisms and warn all those working in the sector that a failure to comply with legislation will result in serious consequences. It will be paired with further activity over the coming months.Alex Murray, Director Threat Leadership at the National Crime Agency, said:“Organised immigration crime is a deadly threat that led to more than 70 fatalities in the Channel last year alone. Criminal gangs are behind these crossings.“The National Crime Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into people smuggling networks, and we are determined to do all we can to target those involved – including those who enable, support and financially benefit from this criminal activity.“Money service businesses provide an important service, and the vast majority are compliant with regulation.“However, it is absolutely key that all those who work in this sector remain vigilant, report suspicious activity, and play their part to stop this horrific crime.“Those who don’t will be pursued and prosecuted as harshly as those directly involved in organising the crossings.”Louise MacDonald, Deputy Director of Economic Crime, at HMRC’S Fraud Investigation Service, said:“Businesses who fail to comply with money laundering regulations leave themselves, and the UK economy, open to attacks by criminals, including those involved in organised immigration fraud.“We know many registered Hawaladars provide vital and legitimate services to scores of communities. That’s why we’re working with partners at the NCA to help protect them from criminals who would prey on their services, and we will use all our powers to tackle those who fail to meet their legal obligations.”Minister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said:“Law-abiding Hawaladars have a responsibility to report suspicious activity, and as this warning makes clear, we will not hesitate to prosecute those who enable people smugglers to profit from putting countless lives at risk.”“This government continues to combat organised immigration crime and tackling illicit finance is a priority as we work to secure the UK’s borders and deliver the Plan for Change.”\n27 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740657600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Firearms and ammunition seized from SUV at Dover', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/firearms-and-ammunition-seized-from-suv-at-dover', 'content': '\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) has launched an investigation after 13 firearms and 300 rounds of ammunition were seized from a vehicle at Dover.\nBorder Force officers stopped and searched the SUV on Monday 24 February as it entered the UK from France.\nInside a custom-built hide in the vehicle’s footwell they discovered 13 firearms, including Skorpions, a submachine gun and pistols.\nThey also found 300 rounds of ammunition and five kilos of heroin.\nTests are ongoing to classify the weapons and verify if they are viable.\nKasha Sanderson, 39, of Wick, Bristol, appeared at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court yesterday (25 February) charged with importation of firearms, ammunition and Class A drugs.\nNCA Senior Investigating Officer Daren Nicholls said: “This is a significant seizure of deadly firearms that were destined for the UK criminal marketplace.\n“Our investigation to track down the organised criminals responsible for this attempted importation continues at pace.\n“Stopping the availability of firearms to UK-based criminals is a top priority for the NCA and we work closely with domestic and international partners to do this.”\n26 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740571200, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Man who downloaded child sexual abuse images as a teen is convicted', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-who-downloaded-child-sexual-abuse-images-as-a-teen-is-convicted', 'content': '\nAn east Londoner who was found with indecent images of children and was linked to an online criminal group that blackmailed young teenage girls has been convicted.\nThe National Crime Agency investigated Richard Ehiemere, from Hackney, now 21,\xa0after receiving a referral from Discord in January 2021, when he was 17 years old.\nThe online platform was concerned about the activities of the CVLT group, which Ehiemere was linked to.\nCVLT is a form of \'Com\' network, which are typically made up of young males who share harmful and misogynistic content, and commit a range of online offences.\nMembers attempt to gain status within the group by committing or encouraging ever more shocking or harmful acts.\nThe investigation into Ehiemere established that the online moniker "Retaliate#1337" had logged on to Discord channels connected to CVLT 383 times and disclosed stolen email addresses and passwords, known as \'combo lists\'. The profile is also believed to have shared indecent images of children (IIOC).\nNCA investigators were able to trace these log ons back to Ehiemere\'s home address in Hackney, where he was arrested in April 2021 with the assistance of the Metropolitan Police Service.\nHis mobile phone was seized and found to contain 29 IIOC, ranging from category A (the most severe) to category C. Conversations relating to hacking, selling unlawfully obtained material and how to avoid detection were also stored on it.\nA computer tower was found with 142 combo lists stored on it, each containing personal details which had been stolen and could have been used to defraud victims.\nA number of accounts and software associated with VPN providers – which are used to mask the user\'s location - such as "ExpressVPN", "NordVPN", "MullvadVPN" and "OpenVPN" were also found. "ExpressVPN" and "MullvadVPN" were used to access the relevant Retaliate account when emails and passwords were shared.\nMore broadly, CVLT member targeted\xa0girls on social media platforms such as Discord.

This material would then be used by the wider group to blackmail the victim into sending increasingly extreme content.\nGirls were forced to join group calls, where they would be instructed to carry out sexual acts and acts of self-harm for their audience. In severe cases, vulnerable victims were encouraged to kill themselves on camera.\nEhiemere was charged with two fraud offences and three IIOC offences and convicted by a jury at Aldersgate Nightingale Court today (25 February), following a seven-day trial. He is due to be sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 1 May.\nSteve Laval, Senior Investigating Officer at the NCA\'s National Cyber Crime Unit, said:\n"Richard Ehiemere was a key enabler for this harmful online group, providing stolen data which they could use to defraud hundreds of victims.\n"Com networks like CVLT are dangerous online environments in which members encourage each other to commit a range of harmful and often depraved offences.\n"These networks are built on extremist or misogynistic ideologies and promote violence against women and girls, who are forced to comply with their extreme demands through fear.\n"The NCA and policing are committed to reducing the threat caused by Com networks through working with industry to identify groups, pursuing their members or those linked to them, and removing harmful content, as well as raising awareness with parents and educators to help them spot deviant behaviour."\n\n25 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740484800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'NCA investigation leads to conviction of gang who forced migrants to work in cannabis farms', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/nca-investigation-leads-to-conviction-of-gang-who-forced-migrants-to-work-in-cannabis-farms', 'content': '\nSix people have been convicted of being part of a crime group responsible for forcing trafficked migrants to work in cannabis farms.\nA National Crime Agency investigation identified that the ringleader of the gang, convicted people smuggler Mai Van Nguyen, 35, of Beetham Tower, Birmingham, was involved in the operation of a number of cannabis farms mainly throughout the Midlands, London and north of England.\nThe properties would be leased in other people’s identities using false identity documents or aliases.\nHe worked with fellow Vietnamese nationals Doung Dinh, 38, from Birmingham, and Nghia Dinh Tran, 24, from Lewisham, London, to exploit migrants by putting them to work.\nA trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard how Shamraiz Akhtar and Tasawar Hussain, both 50 and from Birmingham, were taxi drivers who would move migrants around various properties for the gang, being paid hundreds of pounds a time.\nOn occasion they would also transport cannabis or equipment for the farms.\nA sixth member of the gang, Amjad Nawaz, 43, from Birmingham, acted as a middleman, and was in regular conversations with Nguyen about workers, the buying and selling of cannabis, and arranging for properties to be used in Birmingham.\n\nNguyen, Dinh, Tran, Akhtar, Hussain & Nawaz\nTheir trial heard from a victim of trafficking, named only as ‘Witness Z’, a Vietnamese national who was exploited by the gang after arriving in the UK by boat in November 2020.\nHe initially travelled to the UK to pay off money he had borrowed to fund medical treatment for his wife, and was given a phone number to call by his traffickers when he arrived.\nAfter being processed by the immigration authorities was driven from London to Birmingham, before being put to work in a cannabis grow in nearby Tipton, West Midlands.\nWitness Z said he had no choice but to work as he was in debt bondage to the people who had transported him to the UK.\nLater he was taken to the site of another cannabis grow in Tyseley, Birmingham, where he was forced to help clear up the property.

On one occasion he complained that competition in the people smuggling market was driving prices down, while bragging that he had made at least two million US dollars for his criminal networks through his contacts.Another conversation suggested that he was involved in moving a migrant to Turkey from the Middle East, and expected to earn around ten thousand US dollars from the enterprise.Artan and Jameel were arrested by NCA officers on 23 October 2023, while Fiorentino was arrested the following day at the immigration detention centre where he was being held.Jameel’s phone was found to contain information and messages relating to up to 50 people who had entered the UK illegally on small boats during 2022 and 2023, including images taken on boats in the Channel.Artan and Fiorentino Halilaj were both charged with one count of facilitating illegal immigration, while Jameel was charged with two counts.Jameel and Fiorentino both pleaded guilty, while Artan was convicted on 12 November 2024 following a week-long trial at Birmingham Crown Court.Today (Monday 24 February) at the same court Jameel was sentenced to four years and ten months in prison, Artan Halilaj was jailed for three-and-a-half years, while Fiorentino Halilaj got two-and-a-half years.The NCA’s investigation was supported by Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigations and Border Force.NCA Branch Commander Kevin Broadhead said:\xa0“The scale of Pistiwan Jameel’s offending was likely far wider than just the crossings he was charged over. The information we uncovered during our investigation suggests he was prolific, and was operating over a considerable amount of time.“The way in which he talked about the people he was smuggling and the profits he was making demonstrated he was only in it for the money. He was quite happy to risk other people’s lives in flimsy boats at sea as long as he got paid.“Targeting smugglers like him is a priority for the NCA, and we will do all we can to disrupt and dismantle the organised criminal networks involved.”The NCA is currently leading around 70 investigations into individuals or networks involved in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking, using a full range of tactics to target them.\n24 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740398400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Man who fled to Spain after being charged with small boat people smuggling convicted', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-who-fled-to-spain-after-being-charged-with-small-boat-people-smuggling-convicted', 'content': '\nAn Albanian man who went on the run to Spain to avoid standing trial for people smuggling offences has been sentenced after being extradited back to the UK.\nNational Crime Agency officers started an investigation into Arsen Feci, 49, from Nottingham, and his organised crime group after a coastguard plane saw migrants being offloaded from a RHIB, named Orca, in Joss Bay, Kent in the early hours of 9 October 2022.\nFeci, alongside Banet Tershana, Klodian Shenaj, Jetmir Myrtaj and British national Desmond Rice, used the same location for a second crossing on 23 October of the same year.\n\nThroughout the events, Feci was in constant contact with Shenaj and Rice, meeting Rice on 12 October as he arranged to buy a second RHIB named Aquaholic. Rice then transported the boat from Poole to Brightlingsea Marina.\nInvestigators found Feci was responsible for purchasing equipment for the crossing, with CCTV showing him purchasing maintenance items from Halfords, and sourcing ‘staff’ to carry out the crossings.\nOn 22 October, Feci was under surveillance as he travelled back to Brightlingsea with Rice and Shenaj.\nThe group were having issues with the seaworthiness of the boat, however, which appeared to delay their attempts and the boat was moored away from the main marina.\nFeci was in conversation with Shenaj and Rice. He purchased an inflatable kayak, two paddles and a pump in Nottingham before travelling to London to meet Tershana and then travelling to Brightlingsea. The kayak was taken to the marina by Rice and supplied to two men so they could access the Aquaholic.\nAs the boat began its journey to Belgium on 29 October, NCA officers were watching and tipped off the Belgian Police who intercepted it as it landed on the coast near Nieuwpoort in the early hours of 30 October.\nThe two pilots, aged 35 and 45, were arrested as they attempted to load 12 migrants, including a woman and child, into the boat. Examination of the RHIB showed the six life jackets available were unsuitable for use at sea.\n\nThese men were prosecuted in Belgium and sentenced to six years imprisonment each.\nRice was arrested later that same day and a kayak was found in the back of his van, identical to the one bought by Feci days earlier.\nShenaj and Feci were arrested in Broxtowe Street, Nottingham on 29 November 2022. He was rearrested in February 2023 after evidence of Feci’s involvement with Myrtaj and Tershana was uncovered. He answered no comment to questions put to him by NCA officers.\nFeci appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on 21 March 2023 and was bailed pending his next appearance, but he fled to Spain and remained on the run until August 2024 when he was re-arrested.\nFeci was returned to the UK in November 2024 and appeared at Nottingham Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration to the UK.\nHe was sentenced to five years and four months imprisonment today (17 February).\nTershana, Shenaj, Myrtaj and Rice were convicted and sentenced for the same offences in August 2023.\nNCA Branch Commander Derek Evans said: \n“Feci is the final piece of the puzzle in this organised people smuggling group, taking migrants on dangerous journeys across the Channel and undoubtedly making significant money as a result.\n“While he may have tried to distance himself by not being involved in the purchase of the boat, he was integral in finding people to pilot the vessel and buying equipment to ensure the crossings were a success.\n“Feci thought he could avoid justice by fleeing to Spain but our international reach and assistance from partners saw him brought back to the UK where he pleaded guilty to the charges against him.\n“Tackling organised immigration crime is an NCA priority and we will continue to target people smugglers like Feci and his group working both in the UK and overseas.”\n17 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1739793600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Heathrow passenger charged following £400,000 cash find in suitcase', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/heathrow-passenger-charged-following-400-000-cash-find-in-suitcase', 'content': '\nA man has been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation after £400,000 in cash was found in his suitcase as he attempted to fly out of the UK.\nAustrian national Broomand Nasab, 41, was arrested at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday and was charged with one count of money laundering.\nNearly 11,000 Euros were also found in his carry-on backpack.

They were then hidden in a load of used tyres ahead of being driven from France to Zeebrugge in Belgium where they would have been loaded onto a ferry to Purfleet, England.\nNCA investigators believe they were charged in the region of £15,000 each for their passage to the UK.\nHowever, the Belgian authorities, who were working with the NCA to track the lorry, were able to move in and intercept the trailer at a parking area in Gentbrugge, Belgium, before it was able to board the boat.\nThe NCA investigation found that Nolan, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was responsible for sourcing a driver for the journey and arranged for McLaughlin to travel from Scotland to Kent to pick up an HGV and take a ferry to France to drive the migrants from their pick-up point and across Europe.\nThroughout the trip, McLaughlin remained in contact with Nolan to ensure that the migrants were collected on time.\nWayne Sherlock, 44, from Dover, Kent, was another gang member who was convicted for his role in the conspiracy in June 2020 and received a four-year prison sentence following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court.\nLoughran worked with Sherlock to arrange for an HGV tractor unit to be moved from Ireland to Kent on 4 March 2020, ready to be used in the smuggling attempt the following day.\nMessages between the group showed detailed planning including routes, logistics and how the migrants should enter and hide in the vehicle.

They were working on Operation Venetic – the UK response to the takedown of encrypted communications platform EncroChat.\nOn the platform, Donovan, of Walsingham Road, Liverpool, was known by the handle “Astralcleaner”.\nHe played a key role in the supply of Class A drugs and co-ordinated the collection, storage and laundering of the OCG’s money – between £10m and £13m – in cash through third party business accounts.\nAlmost every single door in his house was specially reinforced when NCA officers arrested him.\nA digital review of Donovan’s devices revealed images of a spreadsheet detailing money owed by and to him, as well as multiple messages indicating the scale of the cash collection, and his interest in the packaging of money.\nThis included: “3,424,000 owed in eng”; “934000 all got it now to come off bill”; “200 + 9 for 4.5%”, a reference to a delivery of £200,000, plus a commission of 4.5% (£9,000); and a note about a wodge of £50 notes, which were “zipped up and tied at the top”.\nNCA officers discovered EncroChat conversations and images revealing that Donovan had also played a significant role in the supply of class A drugs to the UK.\nIn discussions with other organised criminals, he asked for “any news on far ones” (container ships transporting cocaine), and haggled over the price of “botts” and “tops” – references to kilogram quantities of heroin and cocaine.\nIn January he admitted conspiracy to supply 23.7 kilos of cocaine, one kilo of heroin and money laundering of between £10 - £13million.\nFour other men also admitted their roles in the OCG.\nTwo weeks ago, on the eve of his trial, the final OCG member Christopher Roper, 41, of Allerton Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to money laundering.\nRoper would often store criminal cash where he worked, at a well-known garage, the Wavertree Car Centre.\nRoper was also on EncroChat as “sentientwolf” and would use the platform – which offenders believed was impenetrable - to arrange the transfers of cash, for which he sometimes received a 4.5% fee.\nAccomplice James Vaughan, 38, of Green Lane, Liverpool, was previously on the NCA’s Most Wanted fugitives list.\nHe was arrested as part of the investigation in 2020 and officers found more than £2,000 at his home along with two Rolex watches, a Bulgari watch and packaging for a cash counting machine.\nBut he fled to Spain where he was eventually traced and arrested and extradited last year.\nEvidence showed that Donovan would have cash delivered to Roper, who would arrange the payment of it into third party business accounts.

Officers attended the address in November 2018, but the recipient explained that the parcels were actually owned by her neighbour, Tyrelle Mack.\nMack had lied to his neighbour, stating that he wanted to use her address to prevent his mum finding out how much money he was spending on fashion. He was arrested by the NCA later that month.\nEnquiries in Slovakia revealed that the first two firearms identified by Border Force had been purchased by a Slovakian male, who had sold them to an anonymous buyer on a gaming site. His actions did not amount to an offence in Slovakia and the buyer was identified as Mack.\nNCA investigators discovered Mack had received nine other suspect packages, containing eight guns and three lots of ammunition, from Ostrava in the Czech Republic.\nHis customer requests were to “wrap [the contents] up nice please make sure it doesn’t fling around inside the box” and a plea to not include “stickers on the box nothing suggesting where I ordered from”.\nThree further unwitting recipients of firearms were interviewed and provided the same story – that they had been asked to take in parcels on behalf of another individual. Two of the three named that individual as Mack.\nNCA officers later discovered that Mack had spoken to Ishtiaq Shah, 27, a friend since childhood, at relevant times before and after parcel deliveries. Shah assisted him by collecting and storing the weapons.\n\nIshtiaq Shah\nShah, of Vestry Close, Luton, was subsequently arrested at his home, where a loaded revolver was seized.\nIn August 2023, both Mack and Shah were charged with conspiracy to contravene section 170 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, and conspiracy to sell or transfer prohibited weapons.\nThe pair pleaded guilty in February 2024. On 2 August 2023, Shah was sentenced to 18 months suspended. On 24 January 2025, Mack was sentenced to 13 years.\nThat same day, he was sentenced to an additional six years imprisonment for a firearm offence investigated by the Metropolitan Police, bringing his total sentence to 19 years.\nBoth Mack and Shah are subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders, which support the lifetime management of serious criminals and prevent future offending.\n\nChris Hill, Branch Commander at the National Crime Agency, said:\n“Mack and Shah were behind the importation of deadly weapons, which had the potential to inflict serious violence on the streets of the UK, putting members of the public in danger.\n“Mack’s ploy also put his neighbours at risk, directly involving them in serious criminality and pointing the finger of suspicion at them.\n“Illegal firearms have no place in this country, and the NCA, alongside our partners in policing and Border Force, are committed to combatting their supply, ensuring that the public are kept safe from harm.”\nNo charges were brought against the people who received the packages.\n29 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1738152000, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Website operators who promised fraudsters instant profit if they subscribed to illegal service are sentenced', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/website-operators-who-promised-fraudsters-instant-profit-if-they-subscribed-to-illegal-service-are-sentenced', 'content': '\nThree men have been sentenced for running a website enabling criminals to defraud victims by circumventing banking anti-fraud checks.\nA National Crime Agency investigation showed that www.OTP.Agency was run by Callum Picari, 23, from Hornchurch, Essex; Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan, 21, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire; and Aza Siddeeque, 19, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.\nOTP stands for \'one-time passcode\'.\nCriminals were charged a monthly subscription fee for a service which allowed them to access personal bank accounts and other accounts online to commit account takeover, fraud and steal money.\nThey did so by socially engineering bank account holders into disclosing genuine one-time-passcodes, or giving other personally identifiable information.\nA basic package costing £30 a week allowed access to the OTP.Agency spoof call bot, designed to trick victim account holders into disclosing genuine one-time passcodes for their online accounts. This enabled criminals to bypass multifactor authentication on online banking and telecoms platforms, allowing them to access accounts and complete fraudulent transactions.\nAn elite plan cost £380 per month, which offered both a bespoke \'free text to speech\' service, where criminals could type any message they wanted an automated call to say, and pre-scripted calls specifically designed by Picari, Vijayasidhurshan and Siddeeque to target customers. Officers recovered scripts for use by criminals pretending to call from BT, Sky, Virgin Media, HMRC, Mastercard and Visa.\n\nCallum Picari, Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan and Aza Siddeeque\nNCA cyber investigators began probing the website in June 2020 and believe over 12,500 members of the public were targeted with over 65,000 spoof calls between September 2019 and March 2021, when it was taken offline after the trio were arrested.\nIt is not known how much money the group made from the venture but estimates show it would have been around £90,000 if the 3,000 subscribers purchased the basic plan once, and up to £7.9 million if they opted for the elite package on a weekly basis.\nSiddeeque promoted the website and provided technical support to criminal customers on Telegram in exchange for unlimited use of the website to commit fraud.\nVijayanathan also promoted the website, as well as managing its administration and Telegram channel chat moderators, such as Siddeeque.\nPicari was the OTP.Agency owner, developer and main beneficiary. He plugged the service on a Telegram group with over 2,200 members, posting a message in October 2019 which read: "First and last professional service for your OTP stealing needs. We promise you will be making profit within minutes of purchasing our service..."\nHe also said: "Ever wanted to grab a one time passcode for any website? Well now you can! With OTPAgency you can grab an otp for vbv, 30+ sites and also Apple Pay.. it\'s only £30 a week you really don\'t wanna miss out".\nThe OTP Agency Telegram group was deleted after an article published by Krebs on Security in February 2021 prompted a panicked message exchange between Picari and Vijayanathan.\nPicari said: "bro we are in big trouble"... "U will get me bagged"... Bro delete the chat"\nVijayanathan: "Are you sure"\nPicari: "So much evidence in there"\nVijayanathan: "Are you 100% sure"\nPicari: "It\'s so incriminating"..."Take a look and search "fraud"..."Just think of all the evidence"..."that we cba to find"..."in the OTP chat"..."they will find"\nVijayanathan: "Exactly so if we just shut EVERYTHING down"\nPicari: "They went to our first ever msg" ...We look incriminating"..."if we shut down"..."I say delete the chat"..."Our chat is Fraud 100%"\nVijayanathan: "Everyone with a brain will tell you stop it here and move on"\nPicari: "Just because we close it doesn\'t mean we didn\'t do it"..."But deleting our chat"..."Will f*^k their investigations"..."There\'s nothing fraudulent on the site"\nThe trio were charged with conspiracy to make and supply articles for use in fraud in January 2023. Picari was also charged with money laundering.\nThey all initially denied knowingly being involved in criminality, but admitted the charges at Snaresbrook Crown Court, with Siddeeque being the last to plead guilty in August last year.\nAt the same court today (27 January) Picari was sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment. Vijayanathan and Siddeeque were both given 12-month community orders and ordered to pay costs of £760 each. They will also have to undertake 200 hours and 160 hours of community service respectively.\nConfiscation proceedings against Picari have commenced.\nTim Court, a Senior Manager from the NCA\'s National Cyber Crime Unit, said: \n"As this case shows, the NCA has the ability to disrupt and dismantle websites like www.OTP.Agency, which cause harm to the public, and bring those responsible to justice.\n"We would urge anyone using online banking services to be vigilant.\n"Criminals can pretend to be a trusted person or company when they call, email or message you. If something seems suspicious or unexpected, such as requests for personal information, contact the organisation directly to check using details published on their official website."\nCraig Rice, CEO of the Cyber Defence Alliance, said: \n"This is another example of UK law enforcement\'s determination to target criminal services which are industrialising fraud. The Cyber Defence Alliance were able to identify the impact of this service on UK financial services and support NCA investigators, leading to the disruption and arrest of those involved. Law enforcement working with industry makes for a formidable alliance that will disrupt criminal networks."\nHaving a strong password is also extremely important.

Zada used video testimonials of those he’d successfully smuggled to promote himself.Two other men, Dilshad Shamo and Ali Khdir from Caerphilly in South Wales, also used social media apps to publicise their people smuggling enterprise. They were convicted in November and await sentence.Sophie Austin, Operations Manager at the NCA’s Online Communication Centre, said:“Social media remains a key way the organised crime groups involved in people smuggling promoting their illegal services to migrants. It is a major part of their business model.“Once migrants are engaged they then move conversations onto encrypted messaging apps where they are hidden from law enforcement.“Taking down these accounts disrupts the activities of those criminal networks, we are devoting more resources to doing that as it is one of a number of ways we can actively target them and make their life more difficult.“We continue to work closely with social media platforms to highlight such content and contribute to the development of detection capabilities.“As a result, our partnership with them has seen a significant increase in the number of accounts we have identified and taken down in the last year – up more than 40 per cent since the end of 2023.”The social media action plan was implemented in December 2021 to bring greater collaboration against those crime groups using social media to recruit, communicate and advertise a range of illegal services.It sees a greater shared understanding of the threat from organised immigration crime between social media companies and the NCA, as well as a more streamlined, two-way system of communication.Tackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we continue to use the full suite of powers at our disposal to disrupt networks through targeting their social media offerings, financial flows and their supply routes for boats, engines and maritime equipment.\n27 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1737979200, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Wigan man who sexually abused young girl is sentenced', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/wigan-man-who-sexually-abused-young-girl-is-sentenced', 'content': '\nA man who made images of himself sexually assaulting a young girl and then distributed them online has been jailed.\nGareth Vickers, 45, from Wigan, was identified by National Crime Agency investigators after the FBI monitored his sexually explicit conversations on the Kik online chat platform.\nChat logs showed that Vickers, using the online pseudonym \'daddyv230304\', shared photos of the girl in knickers and a training bra and said that he was sexually aroused.\n\nThe images he shared became increasingly explicit and ended with some showing him exposing the girl\'s genitals.\nVickers was arrested by NCA officers at his home address in April last year, after which he said "I was at my lowest."\nForensic examination of his devices showed he\'d searched the internet for teen porn terms and had used TOR, which allows anonymous browsing and access to the dark web.

They were working on Operation Venetic – the UK response to the takedown of encrypted communications platform EncroChat.\nOn the platform, Donovan, of Walsingham Road, Liverpool, was known by the handle “Astralcleaner”.\nHe played a key role in the supply of Class A drugs and co-ordinated the collection, storage and laundering of the OCG’s money – between £10m and £13m – in cash through third party business accounts.\nAlmost every single door in his house was specially reinforced when NCA officers arrested him.\nA digital review of Donovan’s devices revealed images of a spreadsheet detailing money owed by and to him, as well as multiple messages indicating the scale of the cash collection, and his interest in the packaging of money.\nThis included: “3,424,000 owed in eng”; “934000 all got it now to come off bill”; “200 + 9 for 4.5%”, a reference to a delivery of £200,000, plus a commission of 4.5% (£9,000); and a note about a wodge of £50 notes, which were “zipped up and tied at the top”.\nNCA officers discovered EncroChat conversations and images revealing that Donovan had also played a significant role in the supply of class A drugs to the UK.\nIn discussions with other organised criminals, he asked for “any news on far ones” (container ships transporting cocaine), and haggled over the price of “botts” and “tops” – references to kilogram quantities of heroin and cocaine.\nIn January he admitted conspiracy to supply 23.7 kilos of cocaine, one kilo of heroin and money laundering of between £10 - £13million.\nFour other men also admitted their roles in the OCG.\nOn Tuesday, on the eve of his trial, the final OCG member Christopher Roper, 41, of Allerton Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to money laundering.\nRoper would often store criminal cash where he worked, at a well-known garage, the Wavertree Car Centre.\nRoper was also on EncroChat as “sentientwolf” and would use the platform – which offenders believed was impenetrable - to arrange the transfers of cash, for which he sometimes received a 4.5% fee.\nAccomplice James Vaughan, 38, of Green Lane, Liverpool, was previously on the NCA’s Most Wanted fugitives list.\nHe was arrested as part of the investigation in 2020 and officers found more than £2,000 at his home along with two Rolex watches, a Bulgari watch and packaging for a cash counting machine.\nBut he fled to Spain where he was eventually traced and arrested and extradited last year.\nEvidence showed that Donovan would have cash delivered to Roper, who would arrange the payment of it into third party business accounts. Vaughan, who used the handle “lameregent”, was often enlisted to receive, count, package, and store cash, which was then transported to Roper by Kenneth Kean, 59, of Huyton House Road, Liverpool, and Paul Duncan, 56, of Gentwood Road, Liverpool.\nArron O’Sullivan, 41, of Deepfield Drive, Liverpool, operated as “filthyburrito” and “amplebee” on EncroChat, and supplied drugs for the OCG.\nThe NCA’s investigation was supported by Merseyside Police.\nAll six will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on 3 February 2025.\nGary Cathcart, Head of Financial Investigation at the National Crime Agency, said: “Donovan is a dangerous individual who returned to criminality as soon as he left prison.\n“NCA officers painstakingly combed through EncroChat messages to identify him and his co-conspirators, proving the extent of their involvement in both money laundering and drug trafficking.\n“These crimes ruin lives and destroy communities, and the NCA, alongside our partners here in the UK and abroad, will pursue every angle to ensure that those who commit them face justice.”\n23 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1737633600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Pair jailed for attempt to import a pistol from Florida', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/pair-jailed-for-attempt-to-import-a-pistol-from-florida', 'content': '\nTwo drug dealers who attempted to acquire a handgun in the post have been jailed following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nThe Taurus self-loading pistol was intercepted and seized by Border Force officers at Stansted Airport on 27 July 2023.\nIt was hidden inside the packaging for a metallic safe box, along with two empty 9mm magazines.\nMcNeil Colly, 48, from south London, and Keston Redhead, 35, an asylum seeker from Trinidad and Tobago, were found guilty of importation of a firearm and conspiracy to import class A drugs following a seven-week trial.\nColly also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis with intent to supply at an earlier court hearing.\nThey appeared at Kingston Crown Court today (23 January), and a judge sentenced them both to 17 years\' imprisonment.\nRedhead will be deported after serving his sentence.\xa0\n\nMcNeil Colly (left) & Keston Redhead (right)\xa0\n\xa0\nAfter the pistol was seized, the NCA investigation found the intended delivery address was a derelict property in south London, and the name on the shipping label was fictitious.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nFurther enquiries revealed the package had been shipped from the USA and was being tracked using its unique shipping number by Colly\'s IP address, which was quickly linked to his home in the Streatham area of London.\xa0\nOn 1 August 2023, five days after the gun was seized, officers from the Organised Crime Partnership – a joint NCA and Metropolitan Police Service unit – observed Colly leave his flat with Redhead.\nBoth men then got into Colly\'s car and drove to meet a delivery driver, taking receipt of a parcel from him.\nThey were stopped by officers and the parcel they had collected was found to contain half a kilo of cocaine concealed within a wooden desk organiser, which had been imported from Trinidad.\nColly and Redhead were arrested at the scene.\nAnalysis of messaging data on their phones evidenced both men were involved in importing the handgun, as well as illicit drugs, from the USA and Trinidad respectively.\nMessages between the pair included an invoice for the metallic safe box, the shipping label for the package containing the handgun, and details of money transfers overseas.\nThey also exchanged photos of firearms and vacuum-sealed blocks of cocaine.\nA search was conducted at Colly\'s Streatham flat and a samurai sword, machete and crossbow were found in his bedroom.\nOfficers also seized eight kilos of cannabis and drug supply paraphernalia including a mechanical press and weighing scales.\nNCA Senior Investigating Officer Chris Hill said:\xa0"Colly and Redhead conspired to import harmful drugs and a self-loading pistol into the UK, using false names and delivery addresses in their attempt to evade detection.\xa0\n"Our successful investigation has resulted in the seizure of a deadly firearm and class A drugs, and the imprisonment of two organised criminals.\xa0\n"The impact of gun and drug crime on our communities is devastating.

Smoke can be seen coming from the rear of the vessel.\nThe group also conspired with three associates: Ronald Scott, Toby Lake and Stephen Chapman. Chapman was living in France, and acted as the point of contact overseas.\nLawrence was seen buying the vessel from a boat yard on the Norfolk Broads for £30,000, enlisting Baigent to acquire it for him. Baigent ignored advice from the seller to transport it by road, and instead, the boat was skippered from Norfolk to Dover by Lawrence and Scott.\nScott, Lake and Chapman were arrested shortly before the final attempt to set sail and prosecuted by French law enforcement, who were acting on information provided by the NCA\'s case team. They were sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, one year imprisonment, and two years imprisonment respectively.\nDuring that last attempt, French police conducting surveillance near Wimereux, a coastal town between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, spotted the Sorel Light about 100 metres from the beach.\nThey saw 12 people of Vietnamese origin arriving on foot at a car park in the town, who then split into several groups before gathering on the beach.\nFlashes of light were seen emanating from the Sorel Light, with return signals coming from the migrants. Some of them entered the water and swam towards the boat to try and get on board, at which point the French authorities intervened.\nChapman jumped into the sea and attempted to swim away but was apprehended. Meanwhile, the person piloting the boat moved it away at speed, causing a number of French officers to fall off a ladder and into the water.\nThe police eventually caught up with the vessel and detained the people on board. There were 11 Vietnamese migrants, together with Lake and Scott. The twelfth migrant had fallen into the water and was also detained.\nThe UK-based group relied on pure chance rather than navigational experience, attempting to follow cross-channel ferries en-route to France. All the crossing attempts happened in the days before the arrests in France - from Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate.

One such video showed a group of men on a boat to Italy praising him.\nAnother video, posted on YouTube and thought to have been recorded in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq in 2021, showed him at a party with musicians singing a song in Kurdish feting him as “the best smuggler”, saying “all the other smugglers have learned from him”, while he threw cash at them and fired a gun in the air in celebration.\nOne of those arrested, a 38-year-old male from Sulaymaniyah, is accused of working with the network to co-ordinate the movements of more than a dozen yachts transporting migrants into Greece or Italy.\nEach boat would contain 60 or 70 people, who would then be moved on to northern Europe or the UK.\n\nA Hawala banker, aged in his 40s and also from Sulaymaniyah, who is accused of processing financial transactions on behalf of Zada, has also been detained along with another man in his 30s from Sulaymaniyah who is accused of being a middle-man gathering migrants for movement by Zada’s network.\nThe arrests in the KRI took place between Wednesday 8th\xa0and Sunday 12th\xa0January, with NCA officers deploying to the region from the UK to assist.\nAll three remain in custody, and face prosecution for human trafficking offences by the KRI authorities.\nThe operation is the first time the NCA has worked with Asayish (security) agencies in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah to target high-ranking people smugglers who are risking migrants’ lives in trying to transport them across Europe and into small boats to the UK.\nZada himself was jailed in the UK for organising at least three Channel crossings, though investigators believe he was behind the movement of many more, advertising his services on social media and then posting clips of those he had successfully smuggled.\nNCA Director General of Operations Rob Jones said:\n“This is the next significant step in taking on the people smuggling gangs who dominate the deadly cross-Channel small boat trade, many of whom operate from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\n“Previously they thought they were untouchable, but thanks to our co-operation with the KRI authorities, we have demonstrated that this is no longer the case and they will be held to account.\n“Our reach is global, and we are determined to target, disrupt and dismantle these networks no matter where they operate.”\n\nBranch Commander Martin Clarke was part of the team of NCA officers who flew out to Kurdistan Region of Iraq to assist with the arrest operation. He said:\n“The NCA have been able to follow the trail of this network, from Amanj Hasan Zada in his house in Preston right the way back to Sulaymaniyah where we believe this gang were operating and recruiting.\n“We have had fantastic co-operation from Asayish agencies in both Erbil and Sulaymaniyah as part of this investigation, and I’d like to thank them for that.\n“Like us they recognise that these gangs are risking the lives of those they transport, feeding them lies via their social media channels, and claiming journeys are one hundred percent safe.\n“More than 70 people lost their lives attempting to cross the Channel in small boats in 2024, so this trade must stop.”\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said:\n“The NCA has done outstanding work with this investigation, and the success of this operation will have a material effect on the criminal networks currently trafficking people across Europe. When we said we would dismantle the gangs behind this evil trade, and disrupt their supply chains, this was exactly what we meant.\n"Just seven weeks ago, as part of the Government’s Plan for Change, I signed the UK\'s landmark deal on law enforcement cooperation and border security with Iraq and met with the Kurdish Regional Government, signalling our determination to work together to dismantle the criminal smuggling gangs operating through that region.\n"Our security agreement with Iraq is already showing its impact. By sharing the expertise of our Border Security Command, enhancing intelligence-sharing, and providing additional funding to support Iraq’s law enforcement capabilities, we are able to target the people smuggling gangs at source.\n"The criminal gangs operating through Iraq and the KRI do not respect borders or jurisdictions, which is why it is imperative that the UK continues to work closely with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government to coordinate our enforcement efforts and resources, and cooperate on investigations like this one."\nTackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before.\nThe Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into networks or individuals in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking, those inflicting the highest harm, and who are the most difficult to reach. Some of these sit right at the top of the NCA’s priority list.\nThe NCA targets and disrupts organised crime groups at every step of the route, in source countries, in transit countries, near the UK border in France and Belgium, and those operating inside the UK itself.\n14 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1736856000, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Drugs and money seized from car hide in west London', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/drugs-and-money-seized-from-car-hide-in-west-london', 'content': '\nA man has been charged after drugs and money were seized from a car and flat in west London.\nOfficers from the Organised Crime Partnership – a joint National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service unit – stopped 27-year-old Gleni Goleci on High Street, Brentford, on Tuesday (7 January).\nThey searched the vehicle he was driving and found two kilos of cocaine and approximately £50,000 in cash in a sophisticated hide in the boot.\nOCP officers also searched a flat in Brentford and found six kilos of cocaine and approximately £150,000 in cash.\n\nGoleci, an Albanian national, was arrested and charged with drugs and possession of criminal property offences.\nHe appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday (9 January), where he was remanded into custody before his next appearance at Isleworth Crown Court on 6 February.\nAndrew Tickner, NCA Operations Manager from the Organised Crime Partnership, said: \n“These seizures mean that it will now be impossible for the organised crime group behind this trade to reinvest their profits into further criminality and exploitation.\n“The NCA and Metropolitan Police continue to work in partnership to detect and apprehend individuals suspected of involvement in drug trafficking that is impacting London communities.”\n10 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1736510400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Two charged as part of investigation into fraudulent Covid 19 vaccination records', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/two-charged-as-part-of-investigation-into-fraudulent-covid-19-vaccination-records', 'content': '\nTwo men have been charged as part of a joint National Crime Agency and NHS England investigation into the creation and online sale of fraudulent Covid 19 vaccination records during the pandemic.\nWaqas Hanif, 26, of Sherwood Road, Luton, was arrested by NCA officers in January 2022, and\xa0Touqir\xa0Nasir, 29, of Runley Road, Luton, attended a voluntary interview in March 2022.\nThe investigation relates to the creation of almost 2,000 fraudulent records at a health centre in Luton between June and October 2021, and the seizure of £145,000 in cash from a safety deposit box in the town.\nDuring the pandemic, unvaccinated individuals paid for legitimate vaccine passport records which were obtained from online marketplaces illegally.\xa0\nIt is suspected that organised criminals recruited healthcare professionals to produce the fraudulent records.

He was crucial to the OCG because he helped them join forces with a team of offenders from the Netherlands, which generated new smuggling routes to the UK.\n\nSohail Qureshi, Khaleed Vazeer and Ghazanfar Mahmood\nQureshi worked closely with Khaleed Vazeer, 58, of Timperley, and Ghazanfar Mahmood, 53, of Bolton, both Greater Manchester.\nMahmood, who was born in Pakistan but holds Danish nationality, was convicted of being involved in an OCG. The former taxi driver took his orders from Qureshi and travelled to Spain and the Netherlands to develop the operation, and he became a director of a front company in the Netherlands.\nHe was sentenced to three years and nine months.\nVazeer was convicted of the same charges as Qureshi.\nHe helped set up a front company in the UK and helped Dutch crime boss Barbara Rijnbout – jailed for 18 years earlier this year – open personal and business bank accounts in the UK by using forged documents.\nDutch wiretap evidence showed Vazeer supported and encouraged Rijnbout, 53, of Utrecht, to run the Dutch OCG side.\nVazeer was sentenced to 20 years.\nThe offences were committed between August 2015 and September 2018 during which the OCG smuggled at least 240 consignments of drugs.\nThe group set up front companies and rented warehouses in the Netherlands and UK to move drugs hidden in deliveries of strong-smelling foodstuff such as onions, garlic and ginger.\nAs well as the warehouses in Sheffield and Preston, the OCG also rented premises in Leeds, Warrington, Bolton, Wigan and Ormskirk.\nIn total, more than 246 years of jail time has been given to 12 members of the OCG.

He is already serving a prison sentence in Ireland.\n\nJack Kavanagh\nBoth Kavanagh and Keating were part of a trusted group who obtained guns and ammunition while Kavanagh\'s dad, Thomas, was on remand for drugs offences.\nOver the course of 18 months, the men worked with Shaun Kent and Liam Byrne using the encrypted messaging platform Encrochat to source the deadly haul.\nThey hoped that by burying the weapons in countryside in Newry, Northern Ireland, Thomas Kavanagh would be able to lead officers to them and negotiate a lesser sentence for his crimes.\nIn reality, NCA officers had seen their Encrochat conversations and uncovered the role each man had played in the conspiracy.\nJack used the handle \'BasilBadger\' and \'ThiLive\' and had numerous conversations with Liam Byrne and Shaun Kent to obtain firearms for use in the conspiracy and was referred to as \'Junior\' in other chats between the two.\nIn one message, Jack indicates the urgency of obtaining the guns due to his dad being in prison: "Pressure in there is another level, 23 hours a day and can\'t even get on the basher himself.

She was given alcohol by Mark Evans before she and some friends accompanied him to a disused barn. He then separated her from her friends and raped her.The same woman was attacked by Robert Evans several months later, when he lured the girl to a house in Rotherham by lying that one of her friends would be there.\nRobert Evans plied her with alcohol as they took a bus to the house.

The notorious family-run crime syndicate, responsible for trafficking drugs and firearms into the UK and around the world, were sanctioned by the US in 2022.\nThey also helped Russian clients to illegally bypass financial restrictions to invest money in the UK, threatening the integrity of our economy. From late 2022 to summer 2023 the Smart network was used to fund Russian espionage operations.\nNCA-coordinated activity has so far led to 84 arrests, with many already serving prison sentences, as well as the seizure of over £20m in cash and cryptocurrency.\nOperation Destabilise uncovered a complex scheme, whereby the networks collect funds in one country and make the equivalent value available in another, often by swapping cryptocurrency for cash.\nThis provides a mutually beneficial service, streamlining the movement of cash generated by crime groups in the West, while simultaneously laundering crypto for cyber criminals, and helping Russian oligarchs and elites to bypass sanctions.\nThe UK was a key hub, and the NCA worked closely with partners across UK law enforcement to conduct a series of operations linked to Destabilise. Investigators witnessed exchanges taking place at scale across the country where street-level cash handovers were followed almost immediately by a movement of cryptocurrency of the same value.\nAfter being paid in crypto in exchange for their cash, criminal gangs would use the virtual currency to reinvest in their illicit business, buying more drugs or firearms without the need to move any physical money across borders. The financial service provided to such groups perpetuated their violent activity, enabling them to cause serious harm to communities across the UK.\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\nRob Jones, Director General of Operations at the National Crime Agency, said: \n“Operation Destabilise has exposed billion-dollar money laundering networks operating in a way previously unknown to international law enforcement or regulators.\n“For the first time, we have been able to map out a link between Russian elites, crypto-rich cyber criminals, and drugs gangs on the streets of the UK. The thread that tied them together – the combined force of Smart and TGR – was invisible until now.\n“The NCA and partners have disrupted this criminal service at every level. We have identified and acted against the Russians pulling the strings at the very top, removing the air of legitimacy that enabled them to weave illicit funds into our economy.\n“We also took out the key coordinators that enabled the cash-based element of their operation in the UK, making it extremely difficult for them to operate here and sending a clear message that this is not a safe haven for money laundering.”\nNik Adams, T/Assistant Commissioner of City of London Police and NPCC lead for economic crime, said: \n“The networks disrupted by Operation Destabilise were hidden in plain sight, operating from within our communities, moving vast sums of money linked to the drugs trade and serious violence on our streets.\n“Money laundering causes untold harm to the British public, it deprives society of legitimate funds that pay for schools, hospitals and social services. Under Destabilise, the NCA, alongside policing and other partners, has led UK law enforcement efforts to make our streets safer. Community intelligence and neighbourhood policing play a vital role in how we identify and tackle those causing the greatest harm in our communities, and together we can ensure crime doesn\'t pay.”\n\nEkaterina Zhdanova\nSmart is headed up by Ekaterina Zhdanova, who worked closely with Khadzi-Murat Magomedov and Nikita Krasnov to facilitate money laundering.\nTGR is run by George Rossi, his second in command Elena Chirkinyan, and Andrejs Bradens (also known as Andrejs Carenoks).\nAll six have now been sanctioned by OFAC in the US.\nSmart and TGR have particularly strong links into the Russian financial sector and, whilst funds were often routed through the Middle East, their combined global reach extends through over 30 countries\nMany of the money laundering transactions were brokered by Zhdanova and Magomedov. Krasnov would work with courier networks in the UK to arrange for the cash to be collected, then arrange for it to be converted.\nTGR and Smart coordinated their activity, with members of the TGR group receiving large volumes of cash on behalf of Zhdanova and facilitating the conversion, making the equivalent value available in cryptocurrency.\nOne cash courier network investigated conducted cash handovers in 55 different locations across England, Scotland, Wales and the Channel Islands, over a four-month period. They did so on behalf of at least 22 suspected criminal groups operating in the UK.\nA London-based cash courier in this network was being directed by Zhdanova and Krasnov, resulting in over £15 million in criminal cash being laundered. The courier, Fawad Saiedi, was sentenced to four years and four months in prison.\nAnother investigation uncovered an extensive cash courier network led by Semen Kuksov and Andrii Dzektsa, who coordinated with Krasnov. They managed couriers to launder over £12 million in the UK in a two-and-a-half month period, as well as coordinating similar operations across Europe. Kuksov has also been connected to high-turnover crypto-currency wallets. He and Dzektsa were sentenced to five years seven months and five years in prison respectively. One courier linked to Kuksov’s network, Igor Logvinov, was arrested by An Garda Siochana (AGS) in Ireland and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.\nThe NCA-led operational activity in the UK did not go unnoticed by the criminal networks. In late 2022 and early 2023 members of the networks investigated were believed to have reservations over operating in London and, in late summer 2024, Russian-speaking laundering networks in the capital were charging high-commission rates and believed that it was difficult to work in the city.\nThis activity has also been extremely costly to the networks, who are assessed to operate on very low profit margins - often charging as little as 3% commission for the amount laundered. Based on this figure, they would need to launder around £700m for free to pay back the £20m seized by the NCA and partners.\n\nGeorge Rossi & Elena Chirkinyan\nSmart and TGR provide a service that enables Russian elites, and designated individuals and entities to access Western economies that would otherwise be denied to them through sanctions or other financial restrictions.\nIn 2023, Elena Chirkinyan of the TGR Group was involved in concealing the transfer of funds out of Russia, most likely to support the activities of a Russian-language media organisation in the UK. These funds are alleged to have originated from Russia Today (RT), and the entity that owns RT is sanctioned by the UK.\nIn March 2022, Zhdanova worked with members of TGR to move over £2million into the UK for a Russian client, masking the source of the funds and bypassing ‘know your customer’ checks to purchase properties.\nSiam Expert Trading Company Ltd., a Thailand-based company associated with Bradens that was sanctioned by OFAC today, facilitated the export of electronic components to Russia.\nThe networks also support Russian cyber criminals to launder their illicit profits. In 2021, Zhdanova laundered over $2.3million of suspected ransoms paid in crypto by victims to the Ryuk ransomware group. The NCA assesses that the group, members of which were sanctioned by the UK in 2023, was responsible for extorting at least £27m from 149 UK victims, including hospitals, schools, businesses and local authorities. However, their true impact is likely to be much higher.\nSmart and TGR’s crypto addresses showed regular exposure to Garantex, the crypto exchange service that was sanctioned by the UK and US in 2022. Garantex has been linked to payments to companies for components of weapons used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.\nOperation Destabilise has been delivered in close collaboration with UK law enforcement and international partners including OFAC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the French Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire, and AGS in Ireland. The NCA also worked closely with authorities in the UAE to disrupt related money laundering activities.\nSecurity Minister, Dan Jarvis said:\xa0\n“Illicit finance inflicts immense harm around the world and this major global operation marks a significant step against economic crime.\n"Led by the National Crime Agency working with Border Force, Op Destabilise has exposed Russian kleptocrats, drug gangs and cyber criminals -\xa0all of whom relied on the flow of dirty money.\n"The UK and its allies will continue to work together to crack down on illicit finance and the criminality it enables."\nCase studies\nOperation Destabilise: Case studies\n4 December 2024 ', 'date_time': 1733313600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Gang jailed for smuggling £210 million of cocaine hidden in banana boxes', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/gang-jailed-for-smuggling-210-million-of-cocaine-hidden-in-banana-boxes', 'content': '\nFive members of an organised crime group that smuggled 2.7 tonnes of cocaine in a shipment of bananas from south America have been jailed.\nPetko Zhutev, 39, from Bulgaria, Gjergji Diko, 33, from Italy, and Albanian nationals Bruno Kuci, 33, Olsi Ebeja, 40, and Erik Muci, 45, were investigated by the Organised Crime Partnership (OCP) – a joint National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service unit – who identified they were planning the importation.\n\nThey were arrested by OCP officers, supported by an armed MPS unit, at an industrial estate in Tottenham, north London, in February 2021, after receiving 41 pallets of bananas into which the cocaine had been loaded.\nThe drugs had different branded stamps on them, which corresponded to particular organised crime groups that were going to sell them on the streets of London and the wider UK.\nBorder Force officers at Portsmouth International Port found the cocaine on a cargo ship from Turbo, Colombia, concealed within a legitimate consignment of bananas.\nOCP officers removed the cocaine and followed the consignment of bananas until it reached its final destination - Agro Food Ltd at the Crispin Industrial Estate.\nThe seizure is believed to be one of the largest ever of its type in the UK, and the drugs would have had an estimated street value of £210 million.\nInvestigators identified that Zhutev had taken over as the director of the food company in December 2020. Although it was previously a legitimate business, he had acquired it solely to use as a front for criminality.\nMuci was one of the principal organisers for the drugs importation. He was observed meeting with Zhutev, Kuci and Diko at Agro Foods and arranged the delivery and installation of equipment to support the pretence that it was a legitimate enterprise.\nInvestigation into the mobile devices used by the crime group showed Muci controlled the importation and ongoing supply of significant quantities of cocaine across the UK.\n\nAfter Zhutev, Kuci and Diko accepted the consignment, armed MPS officers used a circular saw to enter the locked premises during a raid that resulted in their arrest.\nEmpty banana boxes had been strewn over the floor of the unit, a result of desperate attempts to find the drugs and move them from the site.\nThe men had constructed dozens of cardboard boxes which they had intended to pack the drugs into. Officers also found nine empty suitcases which were to be used to fill with cash generated from drugs sales.\nA forward-venting blank firearm with five rounds of live ammunition was found hidden behind a ceiling beam, along with numerous mobile devices which had been concealed around the premises.\nEbeja was the intended lookout and driver for the drugs, and was arrested near Agro Foods as he waited inside a hire van. Ebeja was employed by Muci to act as a courier supplying drugs across the UK.\nFollowing the arrests, OCP officers searched a flat associated to Diko, Ebeja and Muci, during which they found 37 kilos of cocaine and ammunition for the firearm.\nOfficers arrested Ebeja at an address in Central London, in October 2023. Muci was arrested outside an address in Hornchurch, East London, the following month.\nJohn Coles, Head of Specialist Operations at the NCA, said: \n"The sentences handed down to these men mark the culmination of a thorough investigation by NCA and Met Police officers.\n"By intercepting this huge haul of cocaine, which was one of the largest ever of its kind in the UK, we stopped it from reaching UK communities and protected the public from the scourge of class A drugs and street violence associated with it.\n"We continue to work with partners at home and abroad to target organised criminals at the pinnacle of the class A drugs supply chain and who pose the greatest risk to the UK."\nDetective Superintendent Victoria Sullivan, from the Metropolitan Police, said: \n"This joint investigation between the Met, NCA and other partners sends a very clear message to criminals and gang members in the UK and abroad - we will come after you and we will bring you to justice.\n"The supply of drugs has devastating consequences on communities. This is why we continue to crack down on drugs and the gangs that exploit vulnerable people, while working closely with partners to support drug users through addiction."\nDiko and Kuci pleaded guilty to drugs, firearms and ammunition offences at the Old Bailey in October 2021 and April 2023 respectively. Both men admitted charges in relation to the weapon and ammunition found at the industrial unit and Diko to the ammunition found at the flat.\nZhutev, from West Beckton, London, was cleared of the firearms and ammunition offences at the same court in July last year, following a two-month trial.\nThe jury was unable to reach a verdict on drugs importation offences and he was re-tried for these. However, he changed his plea to guilty on Tuesday, 17 September - 58 days in to the re-trial.\nEbeja and Muci were convicted on 10 October, having faced trial alongside Zhutev for the first time. Ebeja and Muci were found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs. Muci was also found guilty of conspiracy to supply class A drugs (in relation to the cocaine found in the flat).\nAt the same court today (3 December), Muci was sentenced to 33 years, Zhutev to 27 years, Diko to 18 years, Kuci to 21 years and Ebeja to 17 years.The Organised Crime Partnership (formerly the Middle Market Drugs Partnership) has been in operation for 20 years and is comprised of equal numbers of specialist NCA officers and Metropolitan Police detectives.\nThe team works to stop the flow of drugs to the criminal market in London, target upstreamcriminals that impact on London, as well as disrupting those overseas that make huge profits from this illegal activity.\n3 December 2024 ', 'date_time': 1733227200, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Venetic: Final member of OCG jailed today after drugs hidden in digger', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-venetic-final-member-of-ocg-jailed-today-after-drugs-hidden-in-digger', 'content': '\nThe last member of an organised crime group who plotted to send 448 kilos of MDMA to Australia has been jailed for 23 years following an NCA investigation.\nWilliam Sartin, 63, joins co-conspirators Danny Brown, Stefan Baldauf, Peter Murray, Tony Borg, Leon Reilly and Philip Lawson – who were sentenced for their roles in 2022.\nThe individual at the heart of the plot, Brown, was identified by NCA investigators working on Operation Venetic, the UK-wide response to the infiltration and takedown of encrypted platform EncroChat.\nBrown had sent an image of his pet, named "Bob", to co-conspirator Baldauf. The dog\'s tag had his partner\'s phone number on it.\nThe group hid the drugs within the arm of an industrial digger, and organised an online auction to make the excavator\'s arrival in Australia look legitimate. There, the MDMA would have sold for far more than the UK street price.\nThe digger, a Doosan DX420, cost 75,000 Euros. It was first stored in an industrial unit in Grays, Essex – having been transported from Leeds by Reilly\'s company "Mizen Equipment". That industrial unit was under the control of Sartin, who communicated with the others under the Encrochat handles "haplessbadger" and "urbanmallet".\nThere, it was worked on by Tony Borg and Philip Lawson – the latter of whom designed the hide and arranged for a welder to cut open an arm of the digger and seal the Class A drugs behind a lead lining.\nMurray was responsible for sourcing and transporting the drugs.\nMizen Equipment paid a haulage firm £1,600 to move the digger to Southampton Docks. It took almost three months to arrive in Brisbane, Australia.\nAustralian Border Force officers x-rayed the digger, removed the drugs and sealed the arm before letting it move onto its intended destination – an auction house in Brisbane – under surveillance.\nThe digger was moved to a small site west of Sydney in May 2020 and Brown forwarded the Australian OCG a diagram, drawn by Lawson, which showed exactly where the drugs were hidden and how the digger should be opened.\nOn 18 May, two men from the Australian OCG spent two days trying to find the drugs before realising something was wrong.\nEncroChat messages show the six UK men launched their own investigation and held meetings to find out who had stolen the drugs. These were attended by Sartin.\nThe group were arrested by NCA officers between mid-2020 and early 2021.\nSartin had multiple previous convictions. In 2000, he was involved in an attempt to smuggle 480kg of cannabis into the UK from the Netherlands, hidden amongst scrap metal. In 2011, he was convicted of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue, having conspired to smuggle tobacco and tobacco shredding machinery into the UK.\nSartin was convicted in September and sentenced to 23 years imprisonment today (3 December) at Kingston Crown Court.\nChris Hill, NCA Branch Commander, said: "Sartin played a vital role in this conspiracy; it was in his industrial unit that the excavator was concealed, cut open, and filled with MDMA.\n"All of these men thought that they were safe on EncroChat, but NCA officers painstakingly combed through every single message they sent to build evidence against them.\n"Our work with partners abroad, shown here through our collaboration with the Australian Federal Police, protects the public from the dangers of Class A drugs, which destroy lives and communities here in the UK and across the world."\n3 December 2024 ', 'date_time': 1733227200, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'North Lanarkshire man sentenced for smuggling 29,000 skull-shaped ecstasy tablets', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/north-lanarkshire-man-sentenced-for-smuggling-29-000-skull-shaped-ecstasy-tablets', 'content': '\nA man from Airdrie who tried to import thousands of ecstasy tablets into the UK via the postal system in a deal arranged over Snapchat has been jailed.\nThe National Crime Agency was notified by Border Force officers at Birmingham Airport that a parcel had been intercepted and found to contain 29,000 green skull-shaped tablets.\nIt had been sent from the Netherlands and was addressed to Marshall Scurfield, 22, who at the time lived in Coniston Avenue, Hebburn, South Tyneside.

The crime group bought so many onions – between 40 tonnes and 50 tonnes a week, that it couldn’t get rid of them and often sent them back to the continent to act as another cover load.\n“The stench of criminality is overpowering,” prosecuting KC Andrew Thomas told the jury as has he opened the case.\nThe OCG exercised a high degree of criminal tradecraft to evade the authorities.\nGreen rented a hotel room near his home in Widnes, Cheshire, so he could use its Wi-Fi without it being traced back to him.\nOffenders used encrypted communications, faked documents, changed their names by deed poll and acquired live and defunct - but previously legitimate - businesses to disguise their drugs importations.\nCompanies the OCG was dealing with – suppliers and transport firms – would be far less suspicious about doing business with an organisation appearing to have an established trading history and, in some cases, an existing VAT number.\nAs well as bringing in his own OCG’s drugs for subsequent sale, Green specialised in operating a smuggling route for other UK based crime groups.\nThe criminal charges against OCG members related to five separate smuggling plots.\nGreen created a fake paper trail to smuggle £1.1m of amphetamine base oil in bottles of cream bought in Belgium.\nBut a Border Force dog sniffed out the drugs hidden in a van on 29 March 2016.\nUndeterred, the OCG carried on.\nThe offenders used a front company cloned from a legitimate business in Truro, Cornwall, to try and smuggle 8kgs of cocaine worth nearly £1m into the UK.\nConspirators rented a warehouse in Uithoorn, northern Netherlands, and hid the cocaine in four cardboard boxes packed with ginger for deliveries to be made to warehouses they had rented in Bolton, Wigan and Ormskirk.\nThe OCG also rented warehouses in Leeds, Preston, Sheffield and Warrington over the course of their offending.\nIn September 2016 the plot was foiled when an innocent Dutch haulage driver employed to collect and deliver the consignment smelled a rat. He returned to his depot and called the police who found eight 1kg bricks of cocaine.\nEach had different markings to denote the various OCGs they were destined for.\nA month later Green’s OCG was trying to smuggle 57kg of amphetamine, worth about £1.1m, from the Netherlands to the UK.\nBut Dutch officers had group members under surveillance and were listening to their phone calls.\nRussell Leonard, 47, an OCG foot soldier who spoke fluent Dutch, and a man who cannot be named for legal reasons, had the 57kgs in a van and were responsible for its safe keeping en route to the UK.\nBut Leonard, of Kirkby, Merseyside, who was usually responsible for packing the group’s drugs in the Netherlands, and his accomplice went out drinking all night and left the van unguarded in Amstelveen, a southern suburb of Amsterdam:\nIn a recorded conversation, Green told one of them: “If the van’s gone or been grabbed by the police then there’ll be f***ing murders.”\nWhen the duo returned the following morning from their drinking session, they got in the van and drove off but were immediately stopped by Dutch police. Leonard was jailed for 24 years.\nIn 2017 the OCG recruited Sohail Qureshi, 64, Khaleed Vazeer, 58, and Ghazanfar Mahmood, 53, to develop a new transport route into the UK. They joined forces with a Dutch criminal group led by Barbara Rijnbout, 53, and Johannes Vesters, 54, who were jailed for 18 years and 20 years respectively after being extradited from the Netherlands.\nIn 2018, after the NCA and Dutch Police began working together, the vast scale of the OCG’s offending became clearer.\nJoint working led to the seizure of 450kg of cocaine and heroin and two tonnes of cannabis across three seizures at the ports of Killingholme and Immingham, both Lincolnshire, and one in the Netherlands.\nGreen was also convicted of fraud by false representation.\nHe and accomplice Leslie Kewin, 63, of Runcorn, Cheshire, stole a man’s identity and raised a £262,000 mortgage on the victim’s four-bedroom house in Mount Way, Waverton, near Chester, to pay for a drugs debt.\nInstructed by Green, Kewin rented the property and changed his name by deed poll to the same as the landlord.\nKewin then claimed he owned the house and obtained the fraudulent mortgage, provided by a small finance company. The OCG used the landlord’s name to: open several bank accounts; create a company called Blackpool Fruit and Veg; and rent a warehouse in Leeds.\nWhen Green was arrested officers recovered almost £10,000 in cash from his home. His bank statements showed he and his wife spent more than £26,000 on watches and jewellery in the previous six months.\nBetween 2016 and 2018 more than £1.5m passed through Green and his partner’s bank accounts. Between 2013 and 2018, Green only submitted two tax returns for cleaning and hairdressing businesses. He declared a profit of £7,405 for 2014-15, and a profit of £17,396 for 2015-16.\nJudge Paul Lawton told the offenders: “It was only the dedication, persistence and professionalism of the National Crime Agency working in conjunction with their Dutch counterparts that the scale and complexity of your operation was unmasked.”\nHe added: “The harm caused beyond the importation is incalculable. You facilitated the distribution of drugs by organised crime groups the length and breadth of the country. The evidence disclosed drugs being despatched to locations as far apart as London and Scotland.\n“What you were actually distributing was addiction, misery, social degradation and in some cases death. All of that was foreseeable and known by you. You were also facilitating serious organised crime on a national scale and the violence that forms an inherent part of that culture.”\nRob Jones, NCA Director General of Operations, said: “Without criminals like these, there would be no young teenagers dealing drugs through County Lines. There would be no turf war murders or innocent members of the public killed in the crossfire.\n“Paul Green and his accomplices enabled and helped deliver this kind of suffering and misery in communities across the country. They were the crucial link in moving drugs from source countries abroad all the way to UK towns and cities where lives were wrecked by them.\n“They thought they could hide behind a web of front companies, false personas and encrypted communications. They were wrong.\n“NCA investigators worked tirelessly to identify this international organised crime group involved in industrial scale drug trafficking.\n“Our officers’ meticulous work unmasked them and evidenced the scale of harm they were causing to UK communities.\n“The team brought together multiple sources of evidence from overseas partners, seizures at ports and analysis of travel which has dismantled a group operating at the highest levels of organised crime.”\nRichard Harrison, NCA Regional Head of Investigations, said: “The offenders smuggled huge quantities of drugs into the UK. They had absolutely no ethics. They stooped incredibly low and left a trail of devastation for entirely innocent people by cloning businesses and stealing identities.\n“Tackling the drugs threat is a top priority for the agency and this investigation shows the lengths we will go to in order to protect the public.\n“We worked with a wide array of partners at home and abroad, all of whom provided crucial assistance in helping us put these criminals behind bars.”\nMinister for Crime and Policing, Dame Diana Johnson said: “This was an extremely complex operation involving a huge number of agencies working together. My thanks go to every single officer who helped to bring these criminals to justice.\n“We are determined to bring these organised drug gangs to justice and our streets will be safer with these criminals no longer free to prey on vulnerable people in the name of profit.”\nSara Drysdale, Specialist Prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This case is believed to involve the largest ever drug smuggling operation ever detected in the UK. The scale of the importations was immense and the total value of the drugs was worth up to an estimated £7 billion.\n“The defendants convicted in this case include several of the higher-level organisers who financed and organised the drug shipments and who went to extraordinary and complex lengths to disguise their involvement.\n“The series of conspiracies to import drugs into the UK culminated in an alliance between UK and Dutch Organised Crime Gangs to import drugs predominantly on behalf of numerous others. This was a highly organised operation bringing three to four shipments of drugs a week and involving hundreds of kilos of drugs.\n“We would like to thank the comprehensive investigation work of the National Crime Agency. They provided the evidence needed to build a prosecution case which enabled us to seek justice against these 18 convicted defendants. We also extend our thanks to the Dutch investigating authorities for their assistance in the provision of key evidence.\n“We will be pursuing confiscation proceedings against defendants convicted in this case to recover money and assets they gained from their criminality.”\n2 December 2024 ", 'date_time': 1733140800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Organised crime group used corrupt port worker in attempt to smuggle cocaine worth £90 million', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/organised-crime-group-used-corrupt-port-worker-in-attempt-to-smuggle-cocaine-worth-90-million', 'content': '\nMembers of an organised crime group that attempted to import 1.2 tonnes of cocaine into the UK with the help of a corrupt port security guard have been jailed for a total of more than 74 years following a major National Crime Agency-led operation.\nThe operation took place at Sheerness Port in Kent in December 2021, and saw more than a hundred officers swoop on the gang as they attempted to recover the drugs from a container.\nThe drugs, which had an estimated street value of more than £90 million, had arrived on a vessel from Costa Rica and were hidden inside a shipment of bananas.\n\nFrom left to right: Joel McCaughey; Darren Laurie; Ian Woodward; Kyle Davidson; Danny Laird; Michael Turner; Sam Elphick\nThe shipment had been arranged by gang leaders Danny Laird, 41, from Buntingford in Hertfordshire, and Joel McCaughey, 34, from Manchester.\nHowever, they were unaware they had been the subject of a two-month surveillance operation by the NCA, whose officers watched as a series of meetings took place at pubs, cafes and service stations to organise the importation and recover the drugs.\nIn late November 2021, McCaughey flew to Costa Rica to oversee the loading of the cocaine into a container.

The investigation was supported by Gwent Police.\nShamo and Khdir were working as part of a larger OCG to facilitate the movement of migrants from Iraq, Iran and Syria through Turkey, Belarus, Moldova and Bosnia and ending in Italy, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Germany and France. Many of them are suspected of arriving in the UK.\n\nMigrants were offered three tiers of service – the simplest being on foot or via HGV or smaller vehicle, the next by cargo ships or yachts, and the top tier by providing plane travel.\nMoney was lodged with Hawala bankers based in Iraq and Istanbul who would arrange and obtain funds from migrants travelling on particular routes.\nShamo and Khdir used Whatsapp to communicate with people smugglers across Europe. Once a deposit was obtained, they would receive an \'OK\' for migrants to be moved by a specified route or timeframe.\nThey also used messaging and social media apps to provide videos from people who had already taken the journey so they could advertise their routes. In one video, a family travelling by plane details the route and states \'we are very happy... this is the visa, may god bless him, we are really happy\'.\nIn another, a man travelling by HGV tells the camera: \'Lorry route agreement, crossing agreement with the knowledge of driver. Here we have men, women and children. Thank god the route was easy and good.\'\nShamo and Khdir were first arrested in April 2023. Before being taken to custody, Khdir was heard telling Shamo: \'just tell them that we are buying and selling cars, just say we do transfer money from our home country\'. Both answered no comment at interview.\nThey were charged in February 2024 with offences of facilitation of migrants through Europe. Both appeared at Cardiff Crown Court for trial on 11 November. After hearing ten days of evidence against them, both pleaded guilty to all offences today (22 November).

Chapman was living in France, and acted as the point of contact overseas.\nLawrence was seen buying the vessel from a boat yard on the Norfolk Broads for £30,000, enlisting Baigent to go and fetch it for him. Baigent ignored advice from the seller to transport it by road, and instead, the boat was skippered from Norfolk to Dover by Lawrence and Scott.\nScott, Lake and Chapman were arrested shortly before the final attempt to set sail and prosecuted by French law enforcement, who were acting on information provided by the NCA’s case team. They were sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, one year imprisonment, and two years imprisonment respectively.\nDuring that last attempt, French police conducting surveillance near Wimereux, a coastal town between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, spotted the Sorel Light about 100 metres from the beach.\nThey saw 12 people of Vietnamese origin arriving on foot at a car park in the town, who then split into several groups before gathering on the beach.\nFlashes of light were seen emanating from the Sorel Light, with return signals coming from the migrants. Some of them entered the water and swam towards the boat to try and get on board, at which point the French authorities intervened.\nChapman jumped into the sea and attempted to swim away but was apprehended. Meanwhile, the person piloting the boat moved it away at speed, causing a number of French officers to fall off a ladder and into the water.\nThe police eventually caught up with the vessel and detained the people on board. There were 11 Vietnamese migrants, together with Lake and Scott. The twelfth migrant had fallen into the water and was also detained.\nThe UK-based group relied on pure chance rather than navigational experience, and would attempt to follow the cross-Channel Ferry. All the crossing attempts happened in the days before the arrests in France - from Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate. None were successful due to repeated mechanical issues with the boats.\nWhen the Sorel Light’s engine failed, Lawrence loaned a smaller ‘Piscator’ boat from a breakage yard in Hollingbourne, Kent, which itself broke down and had to be towed back to the UK following an attempted trip to France.\nLawrence tried to hide his criminality by using eight pay-as-you-go phones telephones, unregistered vehicles and cash payments made via third parties. He would also use his associates’ phones and leave his at unrelated locations.\nHe is currently serving prison time for unrelated drugs offences following an investigation by Kent Police.\nLawrence, Baigent and Giglia were arrested in October 2018. They were charged with assisting unlawful immigration in May 2022.\nLawrence pleaded guilty at Canterbury Crown Court on 24 October 2024, with Giglia and Baigent convicted at the same court on 14 and 15 November 2024 respectively.\nAll three men are due to be sentenced in the new year.\nNCA senior investigating officer Dave Rock said: “This was a completely reckless enterprise which, had it been successful, would have put migrants into grave danger given the condition of the vessels, and the lack of experience of those trying to sail them.\n“Lawrence and his associates were trying to navigate their way through one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, which was wilful negligence on their part.\n“They were perfectly happy to risk the lives of their human cargo for the sake of profit.

Each involved Kurdish migrants who had travelled through eastern Europe, into Germany, Belgium and then France.\nZada, who was known by those he smuggled as Amanj Zaman, advertised his services on social media, sometimes using videos of those he had successfully smuggled thanking him for his help. One such video showed a group of men on a boat to Italy praising him.\nAnother video, found on YouTube by the NCA and thought to have been recorded in Iraq in 2021, showed him at a party with musicians singing a song in Kurdish feting him as “the best smuggler”, saying “all the other smugglers have learned from him”, while he throws cash at them and fires a gun in the air in celebration.\nBack in the UK NCA officers were able to record conversations he had with other smugglers, discussing movements of migrants, locations and successful crossings.\nFollowing Zada’s arrest in May 2024 his phone was seized. Analysis showed it was linked to a number of social media accounts used to post material, and phone numbers advertised on them.\nHe’d also had direct contact with some of the migrants who’d come over on boats in 2023. Travel tickets for one of them were found on the handset.\nZada was charged with three counts of facilitating illegal immigration. The jury at Preston Crown Court found him guilty on all three charges, and he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\nNCA Branch Commander Martin Clarke said: “Amanj Hasan Zada ran a sophisticated people smuggling enterprise, using social media to advertise his services.\n“While we have uncovered evidence directly linking him to three specific crossings, there is no doubt in my mind that he was likely to have been involved in many more.\n“For him it was all about profit, and he had no issues with putting people in life threatening situations as long as he got paid.\n“People smugglers like him risk lives, which is why we are determined to do all we can to stop them, wherever they operate.”\nTackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before.\nThe Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into networks or individuals in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking, those inflicting the highest harm, and who are the most difficult to reach.

attempted to board a flight to Turkey in July 2022.\nHis arrest was part of a huge Europe-wide operation targeting a people smuggling network thought to be behind more than 10,000 small boat crossings to the UK.\n\nThe operation, which involved the NCA, led to the takedown of a network led by Iranian national Hewa Rahimpur.\nRahimpur was arrested by the NCA in London in May 2022 and subsequently extradited to Belgium where he received an 11-year jail sentence in October 2023.\nAs part of the operation, involving law enforcement in the UK, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, dozens of boats and engines and hundreds of lifejackets destined for people smugglers were seized.\nAround 40 people were arrested for a variety of offences during a joint day of action in July 2022.\nThe trial in Lille saw Poore and the other defendants charged with facilitating small boat crossings between France and the UK, with the boats and other equipment being transferred from Germany and the Netherlands to the beaches of northern France.\nEach crossing stood to net the criminal network around 100,000 euros (around £83,000) in profit.\nA number of those convicted were identified by the NCA, working with OLTIM, through the Joint Intelligence Cell (JIC/URO), a specialist unit based in northern France set up to target people smugglers.\nThey included Mirkhan Rasoul, who is said to have controlled members of the network by phone even though he was in prison in France at the time.\nOn Tuesday 5 November the 18 were convicted and handed sentences ranging from one year suspended to 15 years for Rasoul. Poore was given a five-year sentence.\n\nNCA Deputy Director Craig Turner said:\n“This network were among the most prolific we have come across in terms of the number of crossings they were able to organise.\n“Their sole motive was profit, and they didn’t care about the fate of migrants they were putting to sea in wholly inappropriate and dangerous boats.\n“The NCA is working closely with our French partners, notably OLTIM, to target criminal groups like this, and these convictions demonstrate that in action.\n“International co-operation is crucial in the fight against organised immigration crime, and working with the French and others we are determined to do all we can to disrupt and dismantle the gangs involved.”\nTackling people smuggling is a key priority for the NCA, and we are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before.\nThe Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into networks or individuals in the top tier of organised immigration crime, some of these sit right at the top of the NCA’s priority list.\n5 November 2024 ', 'date_time': 1730808000, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Man jailed for raping and wounding vulnerable girl', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-man-jailed-for-raping-and-wounding-vulnerable-girl', 'content': '\nA man who subjected a vulnerable young girl to years of sustained sexual abuse 17 years ago has been jailed for 12 years, following a National Crime Agency investigation.\nDavid Fish, 46, of Kilnhurst in Rotherham, raped, wounded and forced the girl to take part in sexually explicit videos over the course of two years.\nFish began grooming the girl in 2007, when she was around 15 years old and in care.\nAfter approaching the girl and her friends at a local park, Fish, who was in his 20s, exchanged numbers with her.\nThe young girl was infatuated with the much-older Fish, who often plied her with drugs and alcohol, going on to exploit her trust in him by coercing her into sex.\nThe victim recalled on one occasion waking up to find Fish raping her.\nShe told NCA investigators how Fish would turn violent and in one incident – when he believed she had been flirting with someone else – he smashed a mug against her head with such force that she required stitches for the resulting injury.\nOfficers from Operation Stovewood – the NCA\'s investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse in Rotherham – launched an investigation in 2018, after reviewing a report the victim had made to police.\nThe victim, by then in her 20s, agreed to talk to NCA officers.

They recovered graphic sexual images of the victim as a child, which Fish had taken and kept.\nThis evidence supported the victim\'s testimony that Fish had filmed sexual videos of her – allegations which he had fervently denied.\nHe was sentenced today [5 November] at Sheffield Crown Court for two counts of sexual activity with a child, one count of causing or inciting child prostitution or pornography, one count of rape, and one count of unlawful wounding.\nNCA officer in the case, Steve Palmer, said:\xa0"Fish has faced justice seventeen years after targeting, manipulating and abusing a vulnerable young girl, thanks to the courage of the victim and the hard work of National Crime Agency investigators.\n"Investigators listened to the victim\'s account and subsequently identified corroborating evidence.

Specially trained officers are ready to help victims.\nJeanette Smith, Specialist Prosecutor for the CPS, said:\xa0"The cruel campaign of abuse and violence the victim suffered at the hands of David Fish is appalling.\n"Fish used gifts, drugs and alcohol to groom, coerce and manipulate a child into entering a relationship with him, all for his own sexual gratification.\n"The way he used threats and violence to then control the victim and enforce his demands for sex was completely despicable.\n"This kind of abuse can cause lifelong physical and emotional trauma, and I would like to thank the victim in this case for her courage in coming forward and talking to the police about what happened to her. I hope she can find some comfort in knowing that this offender has now been brought to justice.\n"The CPS will continue to relentlessly pursue justice for victims of abuse and will always seek to hold violent offenders to account for their crimes. I encourage any victims of child sexual abuse and domestic violence to report the crimes committed against them to the police. It is never too late to seek justice."\nThe NCA\'s Operation Stovewood remains the single biggest investigation of its kind, looking at allegations of abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

He added: "he said try get as many of them as you can... only chance he\'s got on getting good result out of this case mate."\nThe urgent messages continued when Kent received a message stating Kavanagh was \'under massive pressure and time\'s against him\' to get the firearms in position before he was due to appear in court again.\nIn April 2021, through Thomas Kavanagh\'s legal representatives, the NCA was provided with a map, leading them to a location near Newry in Northern Ireland.\nNCA officers searched the area where two holdalls were found buried just beneath the soil. In those holdalls were 11 machine type weapons and ammunition.\nOfficers were then able to work backwards, using the Encrochat messages in their possession, to evidence the conspiracy and Kavanagh\'s elaborate plan to bury weapons and ammunition.\nShaun Kent was arrested in March 2021 at his home address, where officers recovered £5000 in cash. He was subsequently charged with a number of offences and remanded into custody.\nThomas Kavanagh, who had been sentenced to 21 years for previous drug trafficking offences, was arrested at HMP Norwich in August 2021. He and Kent were subsequently charged with firearms offences and perverting the course of justice in August 2023.\nByrne had fled the UK, but was arrested in June 2023 in the Alcudia area of Mallorca. He was escorted back to the UK by officers from the NCA in December 2023, where he was also charged with firearms offences and remanded into custody.\nAll three admitted the offences at the Central Criminal Court on 18 September. They were sentenced at the same court today. Kavanagh was sentenced to a further prison sentence of six years to be served consecutively. Byrne received five years in prison and Kent received six years in prison.\nNCA Branch Commander Ty Surgeon said:\xa0"At the instruction of their leader Thomas Kavanagh, Shaun Kent and Liam Byrne orchestrated a cynical and dangerous plot to plant a cache of weapons so Kavanagh could direct the NCA to them and reduce his time in prison.\n"These weapons were viable and deadly weapons that were in the hands of a criminal gang, loaded and ready for use in criminality. What this group didn\'t know is their Encrochat messages had been unveiled for law enforcement to see, showing every detail of their plan.\n"The NCA\'s mission is to protect the public from serious and organised crime, and as this case shows, we will pursue every avenue, including overseas, to ensure criminals are brought to justice."\n22 October 2024 ', 'date_time': 1729598400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Four men sentenced and 1.5 tonnes of cannabis seized in NCA sting operation', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/four-men-sentenced-and-1-5-tonnes-of-cannabis-seized-in-nca-sting-operation', 'content': '\nA group of men from south east England have been sentenced for importing 1,500 kilos of cannabis from Ghana to the UK hidden in sacks of Gari powder.\nAn extensive\xa0National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation linked the men to the drugs haul after it was discovered inside a shipping container at Tilbury Docks, Essex.\nDaniel Yeboah, 54, Kristoffen Baidoo, 48, Kwaku Bonsu, 52, all from London, and Edward Adjei, 48, from Grays, were found guilty of importing the class B drug following a three-week trial at Southwark Crown Court last month.\nThe container arrived at Tilbury Docks from Ghana on 19 December 2019, and intelligence obtained by the NCA and the\xa0Ghanaian Narcotics Control Commission\xa0suggested it contained drugs.\xa0\nNCA and Border Force officers searched the container and found\xa02,335 packages of herbal cannabis hidden inside white hessian sacks of Gari powder.\nThe cannabis, that weighed 1.5 tonnes, was removed from the sacks and replaced with dummy packages.\nNCA officers estimate the street value of the drugs would have been approximately £4.3 million.\n\nPictured: Daniel Yeboah, Kristoffen Baidoo, Kwaku Bonsu, and Edward Adjei\nOn the morning of 13 January 2020, the container filled with dummy packages travelled from Tilbury Docks on the back of a lorry to an industrial yard in north London under the watch of NCA officers.\nIt was met by Yeboah who signed the delivery note using a fake signature and a worker at the yard removed the container’s seal with an angle grinder.\nBonsu was observed by NCA officers circling round the industrial yard in his car before taking photographs of the container using his mobile phone, and Adjei was spotted dropping Baidoo off at the yard.\xa0\nSeemingly realising the drugs were missing, they all then fled the site in different cars, abandoning the load shortly after the container was opened.\nAs the men left the area, NCA officers were in tow, and all were arrested later that day – Yeboah and Adjei in Homerton, Baidoo in Stratford and Bonsu in Edmonton.\xa0\nOfficers found a 10-tonne hydraulic press, often used for compressing drugs, at Baidoo’s address and seized a number of devices from the men, including mobile phones and dash cams from their vehicles.\nFootage downloaded from the dash cam in Adjei’s Toyota picked up his phone calls to Baidoo and Yeboah shortly after the container arrived at the yard.\nDuring a call with Yeboah, he said, “my brother, be a little watchful. It is all a little dodgy.”\nYeboah was also picked up on later calls telling Adjei, “I don’t think the food [drugs] is in it” and “there was Gari inside, they have removed most of the Gari. The people are thieves.”\nText messages and e-mails found on Baidoo’s mobile phone uncovered his plot to take delivery of the drugs at the yard, which he had rented under a fake name to disguise his identity.\nIt was also evidenced that a bank account belonging to Bonsu made multiple payments to a shipping company for the container to be delivered from Tilbury Docks to the north London yard.\nAll four men were sentenced at Southwark Crown Court today (18 October).\nYeboah was jailed for five years, and Adjei for four years.\nBaidoo failed to appear at last month’s trial, and Bonsu fled the jurisdiction prior to sentencing. Both men were sentenced in their absence – Baidoo received 10 years, and Bonsu seven years.\nWork is ongoing to locate the pair and return them to custody to serve their sentences.\nNCA senior investigating officer Saju Sasikumar said:\xa0“These men used their international contacts to import a huge amount of cannabis into the country.\n“Its onward supply in the UK would have had a catastrophic impact on our communities, fuelling violence and exploitation through county lines drug dealing.\xa0\n“Today’s result demonstrates the NCA’s commitment to targeting organised criminals operating at the top of the drug supply chain and ensuring they are put before the courts."\n18 October 2024 ', 'date_time': 1729252800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Paedophile paid woman to live stream sexual abuse on children as young as two', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/paedophile-paid-woman-to-live-stream-sexual-abuse-on-children-as-young-as-two', 'content': '\nAn Essex man who made payments to live stream and direct the sexual abuse of children in the Philippines has been jailed for 15 years.\nCesar Cordero Conejo, 39, from Ilford, was investigated by National Crime Agency officers, after being identified by international law enforcement agencies as a UK-based offender obtaining child sexual abuse material and livestreamed child sexual abuse from a Filipino woman.\nInformation regarding Conejo, from between September 2022 and February 2023, was provided to the UK. This included a number of message exchanges between him and the woman, which were provided by Homeland Security in the US.\nIn one message, she told Conejo that she is giving birth but doesn\'t have money to go to hospital, to which he replies: "well good luck ok, hope you have another girl." Later in the chat he asked her to get the children to carry out sex acts on each other.\nIn further messages, Conejo indicated that he wanted to travel to the Philippines to rape one of the children himself, saying that he\'d pay the woman 100 dollars a day in return.\nNCA investigators arrested Conejo in July 2023 and conducted searches of his home, seizing a number of devices, including a laptop and phone. Forensic examination of the devices revealed they contained in excess of 12,500 indecent images of children, including 4,706 in the most severe category A.\nFurther chat records between him and various Filipino women dating back six years were also identified. One message stated: "Do you have PayPal darling. I wanted to see your daughter today."\nFinancial enquiries showed that he had sent a number of Filipino women a total of £1,300 over the course of six years. At least sixteen of these payments were linked to one woman who abused children known to her, for financial gain.\nA number of child victims were rescued and safeguarded in the Philippines, including three in relation to this case.\nThese three children would have been aged between five and thirteen at the time of the offending. The imagery obtained from the Filipino woman included category A images (the most severe) involving penetration with a number of objects, and oral rape. The youngest rape victim was only 2-3 years old and was directed to perform sexual acts with others.\nIn custody, he was charged with causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child under the age of 13. He was later charged with further counts of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, offences relating to making indecent images of children, possessing indecent images of children and possessing an extreme pornographic image.\nHe pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 4 January and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment at the same court today (17 October). He will also become a Registered Sex Offender for life and was given a 20-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.\nNCA Operations Manager Jen Cruickshank said: "This was a horrific case which is shocking on so many levels.\n"Not only did Conejo orchestrate the most depraved abuse imaginable on vulnerable children, purely for his own sexual pleasure, he displayed his intentions to travel to the Philippines to carry out these attacks personally.\n"He is a dangerous, high harm offender who posed a significant risk to children.\n"The fact they were on the other side of the world probably hadn\'t escaped his attention, and no doubt made him think he\'d avoid detection.\n"However, the NCA has the capabilities and international reach to ensure that offenders like Conejo don\'t escape justice."\n17 October 2024 ', 'date_time': 1729166400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency'}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Jailed sex offender guilty of raping third girl', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-jailed-sex-offender-guilty-of-raping-third-girl', 'content': "\nA man jailed for sex crimes against two girls has been convicted of raping a third, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nAftab Hussain, 45, admitted raping a 15-year-old child in Rotherham two decades ago, today (16 October) at Sheffield Crown Court.\nHussain is already serving a 24-year jail sentence for twice raping a girl and indecently assaulting another, following evidence gathering by officers from Operation Stovewood – the NCA’s investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse in Rotherham.Operation Stovewood officers launched their third investigation after identifying another woman who may have been a victim of sexual abuse by Hussain.Specially-trained officers spoke with the woman, who told them that Hussain raped her in a park in Rotherham.She recounted how Hussain, having spotted her sat alone in the park, harassed her, repeatedly asking her to follow him into a secluded area. She recognised Hussain as a man who had been violent towards a friend and repeatedly refused to accompany him but he became threatening, demanding that she join him or he was “gonna have her”.\nThe girl again refused but Hussain grabbed her, pulling her onto her feet, before taking her to a spot beside a canal where he raped her.\nAfterwards Hussain left the girl on her own beside the canal.\nShe reported the incident when Operation Stovewood officers spoke with her in 2019.\nNCA lead investigating officer, Mitch Leach, said: “The NCA has ensured that the women Hussain raped and assaulted when they were children have had their stories of horrific abuse heard in court.\n“Hussain’s victims have shown enormous courage by recounting what he did to them, and now another woman who bravely spoke out after years suffering in silence has finally seen her abuser face justice.\n“I urge anyone who was abused as a child to please report it to the police. Specially trained officers are ready and waiting to help.”\nAdults can report sexual abuse suffered as a child by calling police on 101, or reporting it in person at a police station.\nHussain was sentenced to a further eight years’ imprisonment for the offence, to be served concurrent with his existing sentence.\nThe NCA's Operation Stovewood remains the single biggest investigation of its kind, looking at allegations of abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

It is the first of its kind, solely focussed on the threat of sexual exploitation in the UK, and brings together subject matter experts from some of the UK’s largest financial organisations.\nIts aims are threefold: to improve understanding of the financial activity indicative of sexual exploitation, and therefore the detection and reporting of it; to identify lines of enquiry in both new and ongoing law enforcement investigations; and to strengthen the UK financial sector’s response to sexual exploitation in order to better identify victims and offenders.\nKathryn Davies, Deputy Director Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking at the NCA, said:\n“In 2023, the Home Office received 8,377 referrals related to exploitation solely in the UK.\n“Victims of sexual exploitation are controlled through fear, violence and debt bondage, and many endure long-term psychological distress as a result of their exploitation, in addition to physical harm.\n“They are controlled and exploited by offenders seeking profit, who treat human beings as commodities.\n“Our work with the private sector is crucial; we can help spot and safeguard victims, identify and disrupt organised crime groups, and make the UK a safer place.\n“This project, which involves 31 different organisations, demonstrates our commitment to tackling sexual exploitation together – our dedication to protecting those vulnerable to exploitation, and ensuring that this abhorrent crime has no place in our country.”\nUsing existing legislation, members from the financial sector have shared intelligence with the NCA, and have worked directly with law enforcement and government to identify trends, patterns and case studies.\n11 intelligence packages have been shared with the Metropolitan Police Service, to support an existing investigation into the sexual exploitation of Romanian nationals into, and around, the UK.\nSeven events – specifically designed to raise awareness of the signs of sexual exploitation, identify emerging trends, and share best practice – have been delivered to over 900 personnel from across the public and private sectors. A number of organisations, including The Passage, have run bespoke sessions for the group.\nSimon Kingsbury, Head of Financial Crime Barclays UK, said:\n“Effective collaboration across public and private sector partners is integral in combating financial crime.\n“Financial institutions can add significant value to law enforcement investigations with our collective understanding of criminal threats.\n“By working together to share data-driven insights and analyse trends holistically across the industry, we can vastly enhance our ability to detect, disrupt and prevent financial crime, safeguarding the exploitation of the most vulnerable in our society and creating a safer and more resilient financial system for all.”\nA spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police Service, said:\n“Modern slavery is a crime where unscrupulous criminals exploit some of the most vulnerable in society, disregarding basic human decency, in order to fund the disproportionately lavish lifestyles of the exploiters.\n“We remain dedicated to working alongside partners, such as the NCA to tackling modern slavery wherever we find it.”\nSexual exploitation occurs when someone is deceived, coerced or forced to take part in sexual activity, including through prostitution, escort agencies, webcamming, phone sex lines and sex tourism.\nVictims of sexual exploitation are typically women and girls, many of whom are controlled by organised crime groups within the commercial sexual services marketplace. The majority of these organised crime groups are also involved in other criminal activity – in county lines drug supply, organised immigration crime or money laundering.\nNatasha Mitra, Head of Helpline Services at Unseen, said:\n“Sexual exploitation continues to devastate lives, with 827 potential victims indicated to our Modern Slavery & Exploitation Helpline in 2023, making it the second most common form of exploitation recorded by the Helpline.\n“Signs to look out for include individuals who seem fearful or intimidated, show signs of physical abuse, have a limited but sexualised English vocabulary, or live in a location with frequent visitors at all hours.\n“If you suspect someone may be a victim of exploitation, please contact the Modern Slavery & Exploitation Helpline for free, confidential support in over 250 languages. Call 08000 121 700 or visit www.modernslaveryhelpline.org.”\nThe project will run until the end of this month, but work to counter exploitation continues to be a priority for the NCA.

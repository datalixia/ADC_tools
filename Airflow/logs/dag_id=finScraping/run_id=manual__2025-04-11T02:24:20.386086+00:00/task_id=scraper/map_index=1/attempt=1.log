At the request of his girlfriend, he withdrew these funds and used a crypto ATM to buy cryptocurrency, which was transferred to a digital wallet controlled by a third party.\nThe problem was, Stephen had never actually met this girlfriend. It turned out he was a victim of a romance scam and was being used by criminals as a money mule. The deposits in his bank account were proceeds of other scams. Over time, his smaller transactions added up to nearly $200,000 in illicit funds, which he unknowingly converted into digital currency for criminals.\nCases like these highlight the need for digital currency exchanges to understand the risks and common signs of suspicious activity involving cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs.\xa0\nThis is also why AUSTRAC recently launched a taskforce to ensure crypto ATMs providers comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws to help keep the community safe.\nHow can I prevent crimes like this\nDigital currency exchanges play an important role in protecting our community from serious and organised crime.\xa0To do your part:\n\nreport suspicious activity: if you suspect a person or transaction is linked to a crime, submit a suspicious matter report\nensure compliance: use resources for digital currency businesses to verify that your business has the right AML/CTF checks\xa0\nreport scams: if you believe you have come across a scam, report it to ScamWatch and the police\xa0\xa0\n\nFurther information\nFor more information, visit our What to know when using crypto ATMs page.\xa0\n\n', 'date_time': 1743390000}, {'title': '\n\tHarnessing data for a clearer picture of money laundering', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/harnessing-data-clearer-picture-money-laundering', 'content': '\nFintel Alliance’s Collaborative Analytics Hub aims to speed up the analysis of financial data, strengthen industry controls and support law enforcement.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nLate last year Fintel Alliance members came together in Sydney and Melbourne to collaborate on the\xa0Collaborative Analytics Hub’s first project. The project aimed to\xa0improve our intelligence picture of money laundering across the four major Australian banks – Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, NAB and Westpac.\nHow it worked\xa0 \xa0\nUnder notice, Fintel Alliance collected a dataset of over-the-counter and ATM cash deposits from the banks.\xa0In a first for AUSTRAC, the banks transferred files to AUSTRAC through a secure, shared digital channel.\n“This was a quicker and more streamlined way of moving large datasets than on previous projects,” said AUSTRAC Deputy CEO Intelligence Dr John Moss.\xa0\xa0\nOnce collected, AUSTRAC trialled commercial software with flexible and powerful capabilities to transform the massive dataset into visually engaging dashboards and models for analysis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nDrilling down on clusters of unusual deposit activity, AUSTRAC and the banks made further enquiries and shared their insights with each other to enrich the intelligence picture.\n“One such cluster resulted in the identification of a person of interest, whom we’ve since referred to law enforcement, who acted upon the referral within 24 hours” Dr Moss said.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nA valuable tool\xa0\n“The combined datasets and new software help us see things that were not immediately visible through our standard collection processes, or to any one industry partner.”\xa0\xa0\nDr Moss added that banking partners and law enforcement had positive feedback on the data analytics and dashboards developed.\xa0 \xa0\n“They’re a valuable tool to provide strategic and tactical insights on a range of areas for financial crime.”\xa0 \xa0\nAUSTRAC’s Intelligence Analytics team led the design and build of the dashboards, with support from data science experts from participating Fintel Alliance financial industry members. Their work included design workshops with specialists from the banks’ financial crime teams, to ensure they targeted the right data points.\xa0\xa0\nThree types of dashboards were designed:\xa0\n\nsummary: providing a high-level overview of cash activity\xa0\nintelligence: giving an in-depth view of a particular theme, for example the use of different technologies to authenticate deposits across multiple banks\xa0\ndrill-through: providing transaction and location information for a specific customer, depositor or deposit location.\xa0\n\nFintel Alliance will continue identifying more projects for the Collaborative Analytics Hub to help fight financial crimes and protect the community by drawing on data and our members’ expertise.\xa0\xa0\n\n', 'date_time': 1743390000}, {'title': '\n\tAUSTRAC puts crypto ATM providers on notice', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/austrac-puts-crypto-atm-providers-notice', 'content': '\nAUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency taskforce has found that some crypto ATM providers may not have the right anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism (AML/CTF) checks in place.\xa0\nIn September, CEO Brendan Thomas set up an internal taskforce of experts from AUSTRAC’s regulatory, enforcement and intelligence areas.

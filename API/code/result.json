            "content": "\nA convicted drug dealer has been given a prison sentence of a year and three months after breaching his Serious Crime Prevention Order (SCPO).\nThe National Crime Agency's Lifetime Management Unit monitored John Cobbina, 59, from Highbury, north London following his release from prison in 2020.\nCobbina has had prior convictions, first in 2010 for money laundering and supplying class A drugs. He was again convicted in 2016 for conspiracy to supply drugs and in 2017 for possession with intent to supply class A drugs.\nSCPO restrictions were granted against Cobbina following each prior conviction. However, he failed to follow these and has previously been convicted for breaching his SCPO.\nCobbina pleaded guilty to five charges of failing to comply with his SCPO, having failed to declare he owned a mobile phone and failing to notify the NCA of a change of address.\nHe was sentenced to 67 weeks imprisonment at Inner London Crown Court on Friday 24 January. A new SCPO, his fourth, was also granted.\nThis order restricts access to communication devices, restrictions on bank accounts and vehicles, requirements to notify the NCA as to his premises, both within and outside the UK, and restrictions on possession of cutting agents.\nThe NCA will continue to monitor Cobbina and act against any further breaches.\nAlison Abbott, Head of the NCA's Prison and Lifetime Management Unit, said: \n\"Cobbina had no respect for the restrictions imposed on him as part of his Serious Crime Prevention Orders but this case highlights how using these powers can safeguard our communities from convicted criminals who re-engage in illegal activity when released from prison.\n\"The NCA rigorously monitors offenders with Serious Crime Prevention Orders and will continue to pursue prosecutions when those orders are breached, as shown in this case.\"\n29 January 2025 ",

            "content": "\nA firearms supplier has been jailed after arranging the delivery of 12 lethal weapons, asking neighbours to take in his packages to “avoid his mother knowing how much he had been spending on clothes and shoes”.\nTyrelle Mack, 27, from Luton, was sentenced to 13 years on Friday 24 January, at Luton Crown Court.\n\nTyrelle Mack\nThe National Crime Agency’s investigation commenced after two packages from Slovakia and one from the Czech Republic, containing a total of four prohibited weapons, were intercepted by Border Force between 2017 and 2018.\nOne of these parcels was destined for a house in Luton. Officers attended the address in November 2018, but the recipient explained that the parcels were actually owned by her neighbour, Tyrelle Mack.\nMack had lied to his neighbour, stating that he wanted to use her address to prevent his mum finding out how much money he was spending on fashion. He was arrested by the NCA later that month.\nEnquiries in Slovakia revealed that the first two firearms identified by Border Force had been purchased by a Slovakian male, who had sold them to an anonymous buyer on a gaming site. His actions did not amount to an offence in Slovakia and the buyer was identified as Mack.\nNCA investigators discovered Mack had received nine other suspect packages, containing eight guns and three lots of ammunition, from Ostrava in the Czech Republic.\nHis customer requests were to “wrap [the contents] up nice please make sure it doesn’t fling around inside the box” and a plea to not include “stickers on the box nothing suggesting where I ordered from”.\nThree further unwitting recipients of firearms were interviewed and provided the same story – that they had been asked to take in parcels on behalf of another individual. Two of the three named that individual as Mack.\nNCA officers later discovered that Mack had spoken to Ishtiaq Shah, 27, a friend since childhood, at relevant times before and after parcel deliveries. Shah assisted him by collecting and storing the weapons.\n\nIshtiaq Shah\nShah, of Vestry Close, Luton, was subsequently arrested at his home, where a loaded revolver was seized.\nIn August 2023, both Mack and Shah were charged with conspiracy to contravene section 170 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, and conspiracy to sell or transfer prohibited weapons.\nThe pair pleaded guilty in February 2024. On 2 August 2023, Shah was sentenced to 18 months suspended. On 24 January 2025, Mack was sentenced to 13 years.\nThat same day, he was sentenced to an additional six years imprisonment for a firearm offence investigated by the Metropolitan Police, bringing his total sentence to 19 years.\nBoth Mack and Shah are subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders, which support the lifetime management of serious criminals and prevent future offending.\n\nChris Hill, Branch Commander at the National Crime Agency, said:\n“Mack and Shah were behind the importation of deadly weapons, which had the potential to inflict serious violence on the streets of the UK, putting members of the public in danger.\n“Mack’s ploy also put his neighbours at risk, directly involving them in serious criminality and pointing the finger of suspicion at them.\n“Illegal firearms have no place in this country, and the NCA, alongside our partners in policing and Border Force, are committed to combatting their supply, ensuring that the public are kept safe from harm.”\nNo charges were brought against the people who received the packages.\n29 January 2025 ",

            "content": "\nThree men have been sentenced for running a website enabling criminals to defraud victims by circumventing banking anti-fraud checks.\nA National Crime Agency investigation showed that www.OTP.Agency was run by Callum Picari, 23, from Hornchurch, Essex; Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan, 21, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire; and Aza Siddeeque, 19, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.\nOTP stands for 'one-time passcode'.\nCriminals were charged a monthly subscription fee for a service which allowed them to access personal bank accounts and other accounts online to commit account takeover, fraud and steal money.\nThey did so by socially engineering bank account holders into disclosing genuine one-time-passcodes, or giving other personally identifiable information.\nA basic package costing £30 a week allowed access to the OTP.Agency spoof call bot, designed to trick victim account holders into disclosing genuine one-time passcodes for their online accounts. This enabled criminals to bypass multifactor authentication on online banking and telecoms platforms, allowing them to access accounts and complete fraudulent transactions.\nAn elite plan cost £380 per month, which offered both a bespoke 'free text to speech' service, where criminals could type any message they wanted an automated call to say, and pre-scripted calls specifically designed by Picari, Vijayasidhurshan and Siddeeque to target customers. Officers recovered scripts for use by criminals pretending to call from BT, Sky, Virgin Media, HMRC, Mastercard and Visa.\n\nCallum Picari, Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan and Aza Siddeeque\nNCA cyber investigators began probing the website in June 2020 and believe over 12,500 members of the public were targeted with over 65,000 spoof calls between September 2019 and March 2021, when it was taken offline after the trio were arrested.\nIt is not known how much money the group made from the venture but estimates show it would have been around £90,000 if the 3,000 subscribers purchased the basic plan once, and up to £7.9 million if they opted for the elite package on a weekly basis.\nSiddeeque promoted the website and provided technical support to criminal customers on Telegram in exchange for unlimited use of the website to commit fraud.\nVijayanathan also promoted the website, as well as managing its administration and Telegram channel chat moderators, such as Siddeeque.\nPicari was the OTP.Agency owner, developer and main beneficiary. He plugged the service on a Telegram group with over 2,200 members, posting a message in October 2019 which read: \"First and last professional service for your OTP stealing needs. We promise you will be making profit within minutes of purchasing our service...\"\nHe also said: \"Ever wanted to grab a one time passcode for any website? Well now you can! With OTPAgency you can grab an otp for vbv, 30+ sites and also Apple Pay.. it's only £30 a week you really don't wanna miss out\".\nThe OTP Agency Telegram group was deleted after an article published by Krebs on Security in February 2021 prompted a panicked message exchange between Picari and Vijayanathan.\nPicari said: \"bro we are in big trouble\"... \"U will get me bagged\"... Bro delete the chat\"\nVijayanathan: \"Are you sure\"\nPicari: \"So much evidence in there\"\nVijayanathan: \"Are you 100% sure\"\nPicari: \"It's so incriminating\"...\"Take a look and search \"fraud\"...\"Just think of all the evidence\"...\"that we cba to find\"...\"in the OTP chat\"...\"they will find\"\nVijayanathan: \"Exactly so if we just shut EVERYTHING down\"\nPicari: \"They went to our first ever msg\" ...We look incriminating\"...\"if we shut down\"...\"I say delete the chat\"...\"Our chat is Fraud 100%\"\nVijayanathan: \"Everyone with a brain will tell you stop it here and move on\"\nPicari: \"Just because we close it doesn't mean we didn't do it\"...\"But deleting our chat\"...\"Will f*^k their investigations\"...\"There's nothing fraudulent on the site\"\nThe trio were charged with conspiracy to make and supply articles for use in fraud in January 2023. Picari was also charged with money laundering.\nThey all initially denied knowingly being involved in criminality, but admitted the charges at Snaresbrook Crown Court, with Siddeeque being the last to plead guilty in August last year.\nAt the same court today (27 January) Picari was sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment. Vijayanathan and Siddeeque were both given 12-month community orders and ordered to pay costs of £760 each. They will also have to undertake 200 hours and 160 hours of community service respectively.\nConfiscation proceedings against Picari have commenced.\nTim Court, a Senior Manager from the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: \n\"As this case shows, the NCA has the ability to disrupt and dismantle websites like www.OTP.Agency, which cause harm to the public, and bring those responsible to justice.\n\"We would urge anyone using online banking services to be vigilant.\n\"Criminals can pretend to be a trusted person or company when they call, email or message you. If something seems suspicious or unexpected, such as requests for personal information, contact the organisation directly to check using details published on their official website.\"\nCraig Rice, CEO of the Cyber Defence Alliance, said: \n\"This is another example of UK law enforcement's determination to target criminal services which are industrialising fraud. The Cyber Defence Alliance were able to identify the impact of this service on UK financial services and support NCA investigators, leading to the disruption and arrest of those involved. Law enforcement working with industry makes for a formidable alliance that will disrupt criminal networks.\"\nHaving a strong password is also extremely important. Advice on this, and further guidance on how to mitigate against cyber attacks, can be found on the National Cyber Security Centre's website – www.ncsc.gov.uk.\n27 January 2025 ",

            "content": "\nNational Crime Agency referrals to social media companies led to a 40 per cent increase in takedowns of accounts linked to people smuggling during 2024.\nThe NCA triggered the removal of more than 8,000 accounts, representing more than 90 per cent of all referrals made, during the 12 months to the end of December.This was a significant increase on the 5,600 removed in 2023, and means more than 16,500 have been taken down in total since the NCA started working with four major social media companies just over three years ago.Among those removed are posts falsely promoting small boat crossings from France to the UK as being via speedboat, posts offering prizes to migrants who refer a friend, accounts offering transport from Africa to southern Europe, and posts offering fake ID documents for sale.\nExamples of social media posts promoting illegal crossings\nThe NCA launched its social media action plan with Meta, X (formerly known as Twitter), TikTok and YouTube in December 2021, to help build understanding of how organised criminals used their platforms to advertise illegal services and limit gangs’ ability to exploit victims and plan dangerous illegal crossings.Since then the NCA has conducted a number of investigations targeting individuals or groups using social media to promote their services.Among those convicted was Amanj Hasan Zada from Preston, jailed for 17 years in November 2024. Zada used video testimonials of those he’d successfully smuggled to promote himself.Two other men, Dilshad Shamo and Ali Khdir from Caerphilly in South Wales, also used social media apps to publicise their people smuggling enterprise. They were convicted in November and await sentence.Sophie Austin, Operations Manager at the NCA’s Online Communication Centre, said:“Social media remains a key way the organised crime groups involved in people smuggling promoting their illegal services to migrants. It is a major part of their business model.“Once migrants are engaged they then move conversations onto encrypted messaging apps where they are hidden from law enforcement.“Taking down these accounts disrupts the activities of those criminal networks, we are devoting more resources to doing that as it is one of a number of ways we can actively target them and make their life more difficult.“We continue to work closely with social media platforms to highlight such content and contribute to the development of detection capabilities.“As a result, our partnership with them has seen a significant increase in the number of accounts we have identified and taken down in the last year – up more than 40 per cent since the end of 2023.”The social media action plan was implemented in December 2021 to bring greater collaboration against those crime groups using social media to recruit, communicate and advertise a range of illegal services.It sees a greater shared understanding of the threat from organised immigration crime between social media companies and the NCA, as well as a more streamlined, two-way system of communication.Tackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we continue to use the full suite of powers at our disposal to disrupt networks through targeting their social media offerings, financial flows and their supply routes for boats, engines and maritime equipment.\n27 January 2025 ",

Two cannabis farms were also found, containing a total of 150 plants. Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as a result of on-going investigations.\n\nThe NCA estimates that £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques.\nCash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash.\nCrime gangs use them to enter cash into the financial system, mixing legitimate funds with criminal profits to hinder subsequent law enforcement investigations. They are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.\nThe crackdown, which is part of the NCA’s continued disruption of cash being laundered in the UK, involved 19 different police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.\n\nIt was supported by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and coordinated by the NCA’s National Economic Crime Centre, which provided intelligence to assist local forces, as well as funding for operational activity.\nRachael Herbert, Deputy Director of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said:\n“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country.\n“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.\n“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest impact offending in the UK.\n“Here at the National Economic Crime Centre, we coordinate UK-wide action, and lead cross-system efforts to make our financial system more resilient.\n“The excellent results from the first iteration of Operation Machinize are testament to the tireless work of officers across the country, and demonstrate our resolve to clamp down on organised criminality abusing the high street.”\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said:\n“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.\n“This successful NCA-led operation highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face and demonstrates our collective determination to make our streets safer, a key pillar of this government’s Plan for Change.\n“We will continue to support the NCA, and other law enforcement partners, as we make the UK an even more hostile environment for organised crime.”\n10 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1744286400}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Preston man charged with assisting people smuggling kingpin', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/preston-man-charged-with-assisting-people-smuggling-kingpin', 'content': '\nA man from Preston has been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation into people smuggling.\nIranian national Anjan Ahmadi, age 26, of Stafano Road, Preston, was originally arrested in July 2024 as part of an enquiry into the activities of Amanj Hasan Zada.\nZada, also of Stefano Road, was convicted of a series of people smuggling offences in November 2024, when he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\nThe NCA were able to link him to a series of movements of migrants into the UK from France in late 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe he is part of the global people smuggling network moving migrants from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) into the UK and Europe.

These are the first convictions for enabling a designated person.\nIn 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Dmitrii Ovsiannikov as governor of the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a position he held until July 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU, and when the UK left the EU, the UK imposed financial sanctions under the Russia Regulations 2019.\nAlthough sanctioned, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov secured a UK passport in January 2023 by virtue of having a British father.\xa0 Dmitrii arrived in Britain on 1 February 2023, and joined his wife and two young children\xa0who were already living in his brother's house in Clapham.\nThe same month, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov applied for a bank account into which his wife transferred £76,000, allowing him to put down a deposit on a Mercedes Benz GLC 300 SUV. However, the bank subsequently realised he was on the UK sanctions list and froze the account.\nDmitrii recovered his deposit, after which his brother Alexei Owsjanikow bought the car instead, and insured it for Dmitrii to drive.\nAt the time, Dmitrii was well aware he was subject to UK sanctions, having already applied to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office to have his designation lifted.\nDmitrii Ovsiannikov was arrested and interviewed in January 2024. Alexei Owsjanikow attended a voluntarily interview about his role in enabling sanctions evasion. Four months later, Alexei paid more than £40,000 in school fees for his brother's two youngest children, a breach of the sanctions.\nGraeme Biggar, Director General of the NCA said: “Dmitrii Ovsiannikov and his brother clearly knew that he was subject to these sanctions and deliberately took steps to circumvent the controls.\n“These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.\n“Today’s verdict is testament to the hard work and determination of the NCA’s Combatting Kleptocracy Cell, which has delivered more than 180 disruptions to remove or reduce a criminal threat posed by Putin-linked elites and their enablers since the invasion of Ukraine.”\nStephen Doughty, FCDO Sanctions Minister said:\xa0“Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions. Today’s verdict proves otherwise.\n“We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.\n“When this government came to office, we made clear we were committed to making sure sanctions were used most effectively – and crucially, robustly enforced.\n“We have been working tirelessly with colleagues across government to ensure our sanctions enforcement regime is both effective and efficient, and to give the right tools to our law enforcement agencies to be able to take robust action when necessary.”\nJulius Capon, Unit Head Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The sanctions regime was introduced against key individuals to encourage Russia to cease military action because it was hoped those with power will be hampered in their normal international business dealings.\n“Dmitrii Ovsyannikov was a high-profile official who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as the Governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia.

She was given alcohol by Mark Evans before she and some friends accompanied him to a disused barn. He then separated her from her friends and raped her.The same woman was attacked by Robert Evans several months later, when he lured the girl to a house in Rotherham by lying that one of her friends would be there.\n\nPictured:\xa0Mark Evans (L) and Robert Evans (R)\nRobert Evans plied her with alcohol as they took a bus to the house. Once Evans had the victim alone at the house, he raped her. She recalled he seemed amused by this.\nAnother woman related how she too was raped by both brothers when she was 14. She knew the men because they spent time with other girls her age.She recounted how Mark Evans walked her home one evening because it was dark, but as they passed through an alleyway he raped her.\nShe and the first victim were later lured by Robert Evans to a house, on a separate occasion to when the first victim was attacked by him. At the house, Robert Evans forced the second girl into a bathroom and raped her.\nThe third victim was age 13 when Mark Evans began grooming her by giving her alcohol and drugs, and calling her his “girlfriend”. The victim told officers how Mark Evans visited her at her home and asked her for sex. Fearing Evans would dump her, the girl complied with his request, and he took her into an alleyway where he had sex with her.\nThese were just some of the sexual offences committed against the girls which the men denied when NCA investigators arrested them.\nHowever, following a two-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court the brothers were found guilty of a number of sexual offences, including rape, on 4 December 2024.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, NCA Senior Investigator Kim Boreham said: “I would like to recognise the courage and strength of the three victims in this case. For almost twenty years these women have suffered the profound consequences of Mark and Robert Evans’ crimes, while the two men continued their lives as normal.\n“These brave women have been determined to receive justice and the National Crime Agency has matched their resolve, ensuring the Evans brothers have been held to account.“I hope the victims will find some peace in knowing their attackers are no longer living free today.\n“I encourage anyone who was sexually abused as a child, no matter how long ago, to report it to police. Every victim deserves justice.”\nSamantha Thompson, Specialist Prosecutor, of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The Evans brothers targeted and groomed young girls including with alcohol and drugs,\xa0for child sexual abuse and rape.\n“The lifelong physical and emotional trauma caused to victims by men like the Evans brothers cannot be understated. This type of conduct has equally damaged the community confidence of Rotherham. \xa0\n“We would like to thank the victims\xa0in this case for coming forward and reporting this devastating crime. I hope this conviction sends a clear message that the CPS will continue to relentlessly pursue justice and prosecute those who sexually exploit children, whenever that abuse took place.\n“I encourage any victims of child sexual abuse and sexual violence to report the crimes committed against them to the police. You are not alone and there is always help available.”\nAdults can report sexual abuse suffered as a child by calling police on 101, or reporting it in person at a police station.

NCA analysts estimate that thousands of users – offenders and victims – based in the UK and other western countries have exchanged millions of messages online relating to sexual and physical abuse.\nAlthough adults are involved in these online communities, of particular concern is that offenders are predominantly teenage boys that often share sadistic and misogynistic material, and have been seen to target those their own age or younger.\nOffenders include a new generation of young, English-speaking cyber criminals who work together to execute data breaches and commit fraud, launch malware or ransomware attacks, and use social engineering and grooming techniques on victims.\nThe NCA and UK law enforcement have identified a number of cases in which girls, some as young as 11, have been coerced into seriously harming or sexually abusing themselves, siblings or pets.\nIn some instances, victims have been groomed into offending themselves.\nNCA Director General Graeme Biggar said:\n“This is a hugely complex and deeply concerning phenomenon. Young people are being drawn into these sadistic and violent online gangs where they are collaborating at scale to inflict, or incite others to commit, serious harm.\n“These groups are not lurking on the dark web, they exist in the same online world and platforms young people use on a daily basis. It is especially concerning to see the impact this is having on young girls who are often groomed into hurting themselves and in some cases, even encouraged to attempt suicide.\n“The NCA is coordinating UK law enforcement’s response to this emerging threat. We are collaborating with policing, tech companies, safeguarding agencies and psychologists to better understand how young people become offenders and safeguard victims.\n“Operating online clearly makes these offenders feel protected and out of reach but that is absolutely not the case. There have already been convictions, we and partners have made arrests in the UK and overseas, and further investigations are ongoing.\n“I’d encourage parents and carers to have regular conversations with their child about what they do online, and ensure they know they have your support should they need it.”\nThe online landscape of these networks is vast, with many groups having a different focus such as cybercrime or inflicting physical harm. However, membership is loose and fluid which leads to the range of different criminality being committed by individual offenders.\nLast month following an NCA investigation, Richard Ehiemere was convicted of fraud and indecent images of children (IIOC) offences, committed when he was just 17 and linked to a prolific online harms group.\nIn January, 19-year-old Cameron Finnigan was jailed for assisting suicide, possession of IIOC, a terror offence, and criminal damage, following an investigation by Counter Terror Policing South East (CTPSE).\nEvidence suggests that offenders are motivated by gaining notoriety and status, which can be achieved based on the harm they inflict and the depravity of the content they share. These networks share content relating to a broad and diverse range of extreme belief systems that they use to justify violence.\nSexual gratification can also be a motivating factor and in some cases, offenders are finding opportunities to profit from their criminality directly, or by selling material to others. The NCA is engaging with experts and academics to improve our understanding of motivations of offenders in this area and what can be done to deter them.\nAlso common across networks is the use of coercion and extortion tactics. Offenders manipulate victims by grooming them, or convincing them that they are in a relationship. As with other types of grooming, this leads to victims not recognising themselves as such, or being too scared to come forward, which likely contributes to the underreporting of this offending.\nJess Phillips, Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, said:\n“The scale of child sexual abuse in this report is absolutely horrific and drives home the need for a co-ordinated response to tackle this global issue.\n“We have seen the heartbreaking impact of crimes such as grooming and sextortion on victims around the world—many of them children who have been blackmailed and manipulated into sharing images of themselves, which has devastatingly led to some children taking their own lives.\n“This is why this government is using every lever at our disposal to make the UK a safer place for children online, including implementation of the Online Safety Act which has some of the strongest laws in the world to protect children.\n“My message to parents is to have open conversations with your children and to seek support if you are concerned about child sexual abuse.\n“My message to tech companies is simple: this is your responsibility too. You must ensure your platforms are safe for children, so that we can protect the most vulnerable and put predators behind bars.”\nAssistant Chief Constable Alastair Simpson, national policing lead for Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse & Undercover Online, said:\n“The growth of Com networks that incite and encourage children and vulnerable adults towards acts of self-harm, suicide and violence are hugely concerning.\n“The role of undercover online officers is vital in this space, and my message to anyone who is exploiting children online: remember that there is no space where criminals operate that we cannot go, and investigations into these networks have already begun.\n“Policing will always play its part, but social media providers have a clear role to play in monitoring and regulating their platforms to root out this abhorrent criminal behaviour and make all online spaces safe for children and adults.\n“I would encourage anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to report it to police, you will be met with empathy and respect, and there are organisations that can support you.”\nChildren and young people are better protected when they have adults around them who they feel they can trust, talk to and won’t be blamed by.

This could be a real photo taken by the victim, or a fake image created of them by the offender.\nNCA-commissioned research conducted prior to the campaign\'s launch showed that 74% of boys questioned did not fully understand what sextortion was, the same proportion\xa0didn\'t see requests for nude images as a warning sign or attempt of \'sextortion\',\xa073% were not aware of how to report incidents and only 12% admitted they may be at risk of \'sextortion\'.\n\'Sextortion\' can be perpetrated by organised crime groups based overseas, predominantly in some West African countries, but also South East Asia.\nThey are motivated by making money quickly, rather than by sexual gratification, and in some cases have gone from initial contact to blackmailing their victim in under an hour.\nAll age groups and genders have been targeted, but the month-long\xa0campaign is aimed at boys aged between 15 and 17.\nThe NCA\'s\xa0CEOP Safety Centre received 380 reports of \'sextortion\' in 2024 and in the first five months of 2024, police forces received an average of 117 reports of \'sextortion\' from under 18\'s each month. However, offences related to Child Sexual Abuse are generally underreported and the actual figure is likely to be higher.\nIn the year to June 2024, the US National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) received an average of 556 reports of \'sextortion\' per week, amounting to over 28,000 global cases per year – up from 26,718 the previous year.\nThe campaign follows an unprecedented alert issued by the NCA in April last year to teachers across the UK, which reached an estimated 320,000 - 365,000 people or roughly two thirds of all teaching staff.\nThese professionals reported that the alert had helped them recognise \'sextortion\', and made them better prepared if they should encounter any cases of it.\nAlongside this new campaign for teenage boys, the NCA is also issuing guidance for parents and carers on how to support their child if they become a victim.

The victim sent images of herself to him but declined to send more when Newson requested them.\n\nHe then threatened to send the images he already had to her family members, friends and school if she did not send further images.\nNewson was arrested by the NCA in June 2022 and when officers reviewed his phone, they discovered one Category B indecent video and 14 extreme images.\nChat logs between the victim and Newson were downloaded from the victim\'s device, which also showed his online profile containing an image of himself.\nNewson answered no comment to all questions put to him at interview.\nHe was charged and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 10 February, pleading guilty to blackmail and causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child. Charges of making an indecent image of a child and possessing extreme pornographic images will lie on file.\nHe was sentenced to two years and four months imprisonment at the same court today. He will also be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) and will be on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.\nPhil Eccles, Senior Investigating Officer from the NCA said: \n"Kevin Newson groomed his victim into believing they were friends. But when she sent indecent images as Newson requested, he blackmailed her into sending more by threatening to send them to her family, friends and school.\n"Newson thought the distance between him and his victim would mean his abuse would be able to continue without detection, but with thanks to our US partners and the tenacity of our investigators, his crimes have been uncovered.\n"The NCA will continue in our fight to bring criminals like Newson to justice and pursue offenders like him who are involved in the abuse of children."\nAdvice for victims under 18:\n\nIncrease privacy settings to restrict who can make contact with you or your online contacts.\nDon\'t pay, stop contact and block: you may be tempted to pay, but there is no guarantee that this will stop the threats. As the offender\'s motive is to get money, once you have shown you can pay, they will likely ask for more and the blackmail may continue. If you have paid, don\'t panic, but don\'t pay anything more. Stop all communication with the offender and block them on any accounts you have been contacted on.\nYou are not to blame: A lot of victims feel responsible but this is absolutely not the case; you are not to blame and help and support is available.\nAvoid deleting anything: try not to delete anything that could be used as evidence such as messages, images and bank account details.\n\nAdvice for parents and carers:\n\nTalk to your child about FMSE: this will help to remove the stigma associated to this type of criminality. To support you, visit the CEOP Education website where there are a number of helpful resources.\nReport to the police: call 101 or 999 if there is an immediate risk of harm to your child.\nReport any images or videos that have been shared: if your child\'s image or video has been shared without their consent and they are under 18, help them to take the following 3 steps:\r\n\nReport Remove: a tool from Childline and the Internet Watch Foundation. Your child can use this to remove images that have been shared or might be shared.\nTake It Down: a tool from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Your child can use this to remove or stop the online sharing of images or videos.\nReport it to the platform or app that the incident has occurred on.

Marchant, of no fixed abode, was next to him. Kelly, of Portway, Manchester, was in the accommodation area and Godfrey was asleep in a deck chair.\nThe Lily Lola was taken into Plymouth Royal Dockyard and the seized substances, which were divided into bales, removed and tested showing them to be high purity cocaine.\nA device that had been on board the Lily Lola was downloaded and some messages were recovered. These demonstrated the boat receiving instructions and co-ordinates from a third party.\nAlso, Godfrey’s phone showed he sent a message to someone saying ‘delete everything u see and not show anybody’. His phone also made the internet search ‘how long does it take a ship to leave peru to uk’.\n\nPictured: Michael Kelly, Patrick Godfrey, Jon Williams and Jake Marchant\nA tracker was found in the drugs haul which NCA investigators established was linked to a user in South America\nWilliams, Godfrey and Marchant made no comment in interview and Kelly claimed he was on a fishing trip. But faced with the evidence against them, Kelly and Marchant pleaded guilty at Truro Crown Court on 15 October. The four men will return to the court on 8 May to be sentenced.\nNCA branch commander Derek Evans said:“The NCA and Border Force have prevented a huge haul of cocaine from hitting the streets of the UK and wider Europe, where it would have blighted countless lives and communities.“We’ve disrupted a drug supply chain and ensured organised criminals are deprived of the significant profits they would have gained had these drugs made it into the country.\n“The NCA is working around the clock with partners here and overseas to erode the criminal networks benefiting from the destructive drugs trade.”\n12 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741780800}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'A prison break, a £190m cocaine plot & money laundered through gold – two jailed in latest NCA Operation Venetic case', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/a-prison-break-a-190m-cocaine-plot-money-laundered-through-gold-two-jailed-in-latest-nca-operation-venetic-case', 'content': '\nTwo men who attempted to import multi-tonne quantities of cocaine from South America, and laundered the profits through a Hatton Garden gold merchant, have been jailed.\nMatthew Byrne, 44, from Sevenoaks, and Beau Devlin, 33, from east London, were brought to justice by the Organised Crime Partnership (OCP) – a joint National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service unit.\nThe pair used the encrypted communications platform EncroChat to discuss their offending, with Byrne using the handles \'slickvalley\' and \'officialcleaner\' and Devlin known as \'scalpcleaner\'.\nEncroChat messages showed that the pair had attempted to import around five tons of cocaine between March 2020 and June 2020 via a number of ports in Europe including Antwerp, and the UK.\nThey also discussed smuggling between five and 10 tons of the drug at a time across the previous eight years.\n\nMatthew Byrne (left) & Beau Devlin (right)\nThe pair had significant contacts in the criminal world - including a firearms dealer who Byrne plotted to break free from a prison van after he was arrested.\nByrne said of the plan: "I\'m going to see if he want us to get him of the van mate I\'ve a few bods who will do it and done it before."\nByrne and Devlin had a detailed knowledge of cocaine smuggling routes, methods and contacts, including South American cocaine wholesalers.\nThey mostly used banana consignments as cover loads, creating companies to act as fronts. Byrne ordered Devlin to burn pallets that only contained bananas, and used as part of dummy runs, as they were unable to sell the fruit legitimately. There is reference to these dummy runs alone costing £300,000.\nByrne discussed the use of \'plug cars\' or vehicles with specially constructed hides to conceal drugs and money, and communicated with a handle called \'the plugboss\' who built these.\nByrne messaged another criminal associate to say that lorry drivers would be paid £50,000 each to smuggle 250 kilos of cocaine, but refused to reimburse their fuel costs.\nSome messages showed that he and Devlin paid £3 million for one particular load of 600 kilos of cocaine, which they would have sold at a higher price in the UK.\n\nImage of gold bars found on Matthew Byrnes phone\nByrne also traded in prohibited weapons and discussed buying Mac 11 submachine guns.\nHe supplied a contact called Jody Hall, who used the EncroChat handle \'unbeatenmoose\' and arranged for a third party known as \'The Boxer\' to inspect the firearms to confirm if they were a good investment.\nHall was arrested in July 2020 while collecting a firearm Byrne was selling via another contact, which turned out to be one which \'The Boxer\' had inspected.\nFurther messages from Byrne showed he was aware of Hall\'s arrest, discussing the type of police officers involved and the possibility of helping him escape by springing him from a prison van.\nHall, 51, of Carters Hill Close, Mottingham, Bromley, pleaded guilty to firearms and drugs offences and was jailed for 12 years in 2020.\nByrne and Devlin laundered their criminal profits through Chris O\'Shea, who owned a jeweller in Hatton Garden and used the EncroChat handle \'allstargin\'.\nBoth men exchanged cash with O\'Shea for clean money, gold bars and designer watches. Byrne laundered hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash at a time and bought gold for himself and others, including 10-15 at a price of around £40,000 per bar.\nHe tasked Devlin with transferring cash/gold to and from O\'Shea. Devlin personally requested £100,000 in clean, new, £20 notes, for which he agreed to pay O\'Shea 3% commission.\nO\'Shea, 56, of Avery Hill Road, New Eltham, pleaded guilty to money laundering and drugs offences in January 2024 and was jailed for 11 years.\n\nImage of firearms and silencers sent by Matthew Byrne to criminal contacts\nOCP officers arrested Byrne and Devlin in October 2020. At Byrne\'s address they seized £20,000 in cash from a bedside drawer, correspondence showing large amounts of cash in bank accounts, designer clothing, a brand new Jaguar car and an EncroChat phone. It was also noted that he was building a house next door.\nByrne\'s girlfriend\'s address was also searched, where officers had to break through an expensive reinforced door. They found various other items showing signs of wealth inside the house, such as designer clothing and leaflets for villas for sale in Portugal. A taser and correspondence in Devlin\'s name were found when they searched Byrne\'s parents\' home.\nDevlin\'s then address in Weald Road, Sevenoaks, was also searched. Officers found CS spray, a surveillance bug detecting kit, around £5,000 in cash and a large number of designer items such as shoes, clothing and jewellery.\nThe NCA\'s investigation formed part of Operation Venetic, the UK NCA-led law enforcement response to the takedown of the EncroChat service in June 2020.\nByrne and Devlin pleaded guilty to drugs and money laundering offences at Maidstone Crown Court on 9 January this year. Firearms charges against Byrne will lie on file.\nAt the same court today (7 March), Byrne was sentenced to 21-and-a-half years imprisonment and Devlin to 17 years imprisonment.\nAndrew Tickner, NCA Operations Manager from the OCP, said: \n"Matthew Byrne and Beau Devlin were at the pinnacle of this highly sophisticated and organised criminal group.\n"They were responsible for flooding the UK\'s streets with enormous quantities of cocaine via their contacts for onward sale, laundering the profits via gold and expensive watches.\n"They were across every stage of the drugs\' journey from South America, going to the trouble of organising dummy runs in an attempt to trick law enforcement into believing that they were running a legitimate business.\n"Although Byrne\'s firearms venture would have made him a useful contact to those in the criminal underworld, it\'s chilling to think about the violence and intimidation these weapons would have unleashed. These are the latest in a very long line of extremely dangerous offenders brought to justice because of Operation Venetic.\n"We continue to work with partners at home and abroad to target organised criminals who pose the greatest risk to the UK by being at the forefront of the class A drugs and firearms supply chain."\nThe Organised Crime Partnership (formerly the Middle Market Drugs Partnership) has been in operation for 20 years and is comprised of equal numbers of specialist NCA officers and Metropolitan Police detectives.\nThe team works to stop the flow of drugs to the criminal market in London, target upstream criminals that impact on London, as well as disrupting those overseas that make huge profits from this illegal activity.\n7 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741348800}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Man jailed over gun parts hidden in 48-year-old car from Pakistan', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-jailed-over-gun-parts-hidden-in-48-year-old-car-from-pakistan', 'content': '\nA man who tried to smuggle 72 firearms parts in a car shipped from Pakistan to the United Kingdom has today been jailed for eight years.\nYasir Khan, 40, pleaded guilty after a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation proved he was behind the bid to smuggle 36 top slides and 36 barrels for 9mm Glock self-loading pistols in a 1976 Datsun Sunny.\nThe haul was expertly hidden in the vehicle.\nThe illegal parts were secreted underneath the windscreen, behind the engine block and in the fuel tank, and were discovered by NCA colleagues from Border Force during a search on 7 July 2024 at London Gateway Port.\n\nNCA officers began an investigation and Khan, who claimed he was a car dealer, was arrested by officers from the agency’s Armed Operations Unit on 12 July in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter.\nToday, Khan, of Lea Road, Sparkhill, Birmingham, appeared at the city’s crown court and was sentenced after he admitted smuggling firearms.\nNCA officers discovered voice notes on his phone showing evidence of a contact with a supplier in Pakistan who had access to the manufacture of component parts for firearms.\nThe armourer had invited Khan to view “the factory” during summer 2023.\nKhan is suspected of a similar importation in November 2023. Mobile phone voice notes and videos showed him struggling with ammunition jamming in the firearms once they had been constructed and test fired.\nEvidence also showed that during 2023, Khan purchased several deactivated firearms which it is believed he was able to convert into viable lethal firearms once again.\n\nNCA Senior Investigating Officer David Phillips said: \n“Working with our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, preventing illegal firearms from reaching the streets of the UK is a key priority for the NCA.\n“The NCA and Border Force have prevented this huge array of component parts from entering the criminal marketplace and being used to produce lethal firearms for organised crime groups.”\n7 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741348800}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Smugglers prevented from bringing 27 tonnes of cannabis into the UK in 2024', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/smugglers-prevented-from-bringing-27-tonnes-of-cannabis-into-the-uk-in-2024', 'content': '\nAlmost 27 tonnes of cannabis was seized from smugglers flying into UK airports last year - around five times more than in 2023.\nIn August last year the National Crime Agency (NCA) issued a warning to travellers arriving into the UK from Thailand, Canada and the United States that they face jail sentences if caught attempting to bring cannabis into the country. The warning was issued following a huge increase in arrests and seizures.\nLast year 26,924kg of cannabis was seized from around 750 smugglers flying into UK airports. This quantity is nearly five times more than the 5,609kg of cannabis seized for the whole of 2023, when 134 suspects were arrested.\n\nThe 2024 total is an exponential increase on the two tonnes of cannabis seized in 2022.\nIn 2024, 430 suspects were arrested at Heathrow Airport where 14,617kg of cannabis was seized.\nThe next worst affected airports were Manchester Airport, where around 135 arrests were made and 4,815kg of cannabis seized, and Birmingham Airport, where 40 arrests were made and 1,410kg cannabis seized.\nOf the suspects, 460 were arrested having arrived from Thailand; 108 arriving from Canada and 63 arriving from the USA. The remainder had flown in from a variety of other countries.\nBy national breakdown, around 290 UK citizens, 162 Malaysians, 86 Canadians and 52 Americans were arrested on suspicion of smuggling cannabis into the UK on commercial flights.\nThe NCA judges that the trend is being fuelled by organised crime groups that have access to cannabis grown overseas in locations where it is legal, and recruiting couriers to transport it to the UK where it can generate greater profit for them.\nAlex Murray, NCA Director of threat leadership, said:\n“Border Force have been excellent in detecting these couriers at the border, after which the NCA takes on the investigation. The NCA continues to work with law enforcement partners in both the UK, and overseas to target high-risk routes, seize shipments of drugs and disrupt the criminal gangs involved, denying them profits. We have been working well with the Thai authorities who are also keen to intervene.\n“Organised crime groups make significant profits by trafficking and selling perceived high-quality cannabis legally grown in the USA, Canada and Thailand illegally in the UK.\n“Couriers run the risk of a potentially life-changing prison sentence. Our targeting of them is crucial to breaking the supply chain.\n“We reissue our appeal to anyone who is asked to smuggle cannabis to think very carefully about the potential consequences of their actions, and the risks they run. Organised criminals can be persuasive and offer to pay smugglers. But as the numbers show, the risk of getting caught is very high, and simply isn’t worth it.”\n\nDanny Hewitt, Director of National Operational Headquarters for Border Force said: \n"Drugs have devastating impacts and ruin lives, which is why we are working tirelessly to prevent criminals from smuggling drugs across the border and ensure they face the full force of the law.\n“We continue to work closely with the NCA to break drug supply chains and keep our streets safe from harmful substances.”\nPotential couriers should be aware that the sentence for cannabis importation in the UK is up to 14 years in prison.\nIn 2024, at least 414 people were convicted of smuggling cannabis via UK airports.\nPassengers were most often found to be carrying between 15 and 40 kilos of cannabis inside their checked-in luggage.\nIn one case last year, however, Spanish national Fernando Mayans Fuster, 51, was caught at Manchester Airport with eight suitcases containing 158 kilos of the drug, after arriving on a flight from Los Angeles. This is believed to be one of the largest passenger seizures of its kind at Manchester Airport. Mayans Fuster was jailed for three years and four months.\nOn 9 August, 11 British passengers were arrested at Birmingham Airport after a total of 510 kilos of cannabis was found inside 28 suitcases. All the passengers had travelled from Thailand, transiting at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Their cases are believed to be linked.\nIn some instances, officers have recovered electronic trackers with the drugs, believed to have been placed in there by organised criminals at source so they could follow the illicit loads.\nAnyone with information on the smuggling of drugs through UK ports is urged to report it, anonymously if they prefer, by calling Border Force’s Customs Hotline on 0800 595 000.\n6 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741262400}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Two men jailed for almost 40 years for raping girls at parties', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-two-men-jailed-for-almost-40-years-for-raping-girls-at-parties', 'content': "\nTwo men who got children drunk and then abused them at parties have been jailed for 38 and a half years in total, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nRomauld Stefan Houphouet, 37, an Ivoirian national of Sheffield, and Absolom Sigiyo, 42, a Zimbabwean national of Rotherham were found guilty of raping two 15-year-old girls countless times between 2011 and 2012, at Sheffield Crown Court on 3 March.\nSigiyo was also found guilty of intimidating one of the victims when he pressured her in an attempt to stop her supporting the NCA investigation launched in 2018.\nHouphouet has been sentenced to 20 years in prison and Sigiyo has been jailed for 18 years and six months.\nThe judge ordered that both men would be subject to restraint orders, to prevent them contacting the victims, and that they must sign the Sexual Offences Register.The victims told investigators they were taken to numerous parties in Rotherham where they were given alcohol and abused by the men, some of whom openly referred to them as “fresh meat”.\nThe abuse began within minutes of the victims’ first encounter with Houphouet in 2011. Then aged 24, Houphouet, approached the girls in Rotherham Town Centre and invited them to a party. He asked to speak alone with one of the girls and took her into an alleyway, where he raped her.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nPictured:\xa0Absolom Sigiyo (left) and\xa0Romauld Houphouet (right)\nAfter the attack, Houphouet took the girls to a house party at Sigiyo’s home where there were a number of men, including Sigiyo and Brzozowski.

She and her friend were given alcohol, after which she was sick in the bathroom. When she came out of the room, Houphouet took her into a bedroom and raped her for the second time that evening.\nFrom this day on, the men regularly found the girls in the town centre and pressured them to go to Sigiyo’s home.\nThe victims described having chaotic lives and living in a care home from which they wanted to escape. Both men took advantage of the girls’ vulnerability, grooming and exploiting them. Sigiyo paid for taxis to his place and gave them cigarettes and alcohol. Once the girls had accepted these offerings, Sigiyo and Houphouet demanded the girls give them sex in return.\nSigiyo and Houphouet raped the girls multiple times. The second victim described being raped two to three times a week by Sigiyo, and on one occasion woke up to find him attempting to rape her.The first victim told NCA investigators how Houphouet was possessive of her. She related how on one occasion Houphouet verbally abused and raped her in an act of revenge, after finding his lodger Jacek Brzozowski \xa0having sex with her at one of the parties.\xa0\nThe girl was also raped by Sigiyo.\nSpecially trained officers from Operation Stovewood – the NCA’s investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse in Rotherham – contacted the women, who are both now in their 20s, after identifying they were potentially victims. The women subsequently told officers about the abuse.While under investigation for rape, Sigiyo approached one of the women on the street and pressured her to tell police he was innocent. But the woman instead reported what he had done, and NCA officers further arrested Sigiyo on suspicion of intimidation. Sigiyo was charged with this and numerous sexual offences and Houphouet and Brzozowski were charged with sexual offences in November 2022.Senior Investigating Officer Kath Blain said:\xa0“Words can barely describe the bravery these two women have shown in reporting what happened to them. It cannot have been easy for the women to have relived the terrible abuse they suffered but they did so with strength, courage and utmost dignity.\n“I’m so pleased that the National Crime Agency and its partners have secured justice for both women. Sigiyo and Houphouet are now facing the consequences of their horrendous crimes against two vulnerable girls.\xa0“I really hope this case gives other survivors of child abuse the confidence to report what has happened to them.”Sexual abuse can be reported to police in person or by calling 101. Police officers specially trained to investigate such cases are ready and waiting to help victims.\nMartin McRobb, Specialist Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said:\xa0“These defendants preyed on vulnerable young girls who they knew they could groom with alcohol and gifts with the sole aim of repeatedly sexually exploiting them.\n“The victims in this case are now adults but they have had to live with the trauma caused by the vile and serious sexual offences committed against them in their youth.\n“We know it can be difficult to talk about such abuse, and I would like to extend my thanks to the victims for the courage and fortitude they showed in coming forward and giving evidence against these men.\n“The Crown Prosecution Service will continue to work closely with law enforcement partners to support all victims of child sexual abuse as we relentlessly pursue justice on their behalf.”Jacek Brzozowski 35, a Polish national of Rotherham, will be sentenced for sexual activity with one of the girls at Sheffield Crown Court on 14 April.\nThe NCA's Operation Stovewood remains the single biggest investigation of its kind, looking at allegations of abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

Last year more than 70 people died attempting to cross the Channel by small boat, so tackling the criminal networks involved remains a priority for the NCA, both domestically and internationally.\nSCPOs are another tactic available to target, disrupt and dismantle people smuggling networks with a footprint in the UK.\n\nDoksani, Nguyen & Styles\nThis publication of SCPOs include Eglantin Doksani, who was made subject of an SCPO for his role in facilitating the movement of hundreds of migrants into the United Kingdom using small boats over the Channel. Doksani was sentenced to nine years and nine months in prison in July 2024, and was given a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order which will become live upon release from prison.\nDoksani acted as an agent for migrants and arranged spaces on boats. He was in direct contact with people smugglers operating in Europe and NCA investigators identified him as an associate of Hewa Rahimpur, a leader of a gang involved in moving 10,000 people to the UK. Doksani had used a fraudulent passport to open bank accounts to deposit his criminal profits.\nHis order includes restrictions around his communication devices, possession of money and bank accounts, notification of finances and assets, notification of travel outside the United Kingdom and prohibition on the possession of official documentation - preventing him from being in possession of official identity documents that do not belong to him or family members or for anyone not residing in the same address.\nAs part of the order he will also have to give the NCA notification of his residence.\nPeople smuggler Mai Van Nguyen was also made subject of a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order after he was convicted for his role in the movement of Vietnamese illegal migrants into the United Kingdom in the backs of lorries.\nHe was jailed for that offence for five-and-a-half years in November 2023, and on 24 February 2025, a jury found him guilty of further charges relating to exploitation of migrants being made to work in cannabis farms run by his gang.\nNguyen worked and was involved in multiple crossings for Vietnamese nationals, playing a key role in meeting the migrants on their arrival into the UK.\nHe facilitated the movement of migrants to safe houses operated by his organised crime group in the West Midlands and collected payments from the people he helped to smuggle. Some of those he helped bring to the UK are believed to have ended up working in cannabis factories.\nHis order includes restrictions round communication devices, possession of cash, notification of finances and assets, and notification of premises both within and outside the UK.\nRichard Styles was also made subject of a five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order after being jailed for seven years for his role in a plot to smuggle four Albanians into the United Kingdom by flying them to an airfield in Northamptonshire.\nStyles was a qualified pilot who flew to Belgium to meet an associate and then flew the four migrants into the United Kingdom. He was arrested upon landing the plane and convicted of facilitating a breach of immigration law.\nHis order includes restrictions around communication devices, prohibition of private aircraft, restriction on travel and travel documents, prohibition on importations and notification requirements of entry to airports or airfields or the boundaries of an airport or airfield.\nAlison Abbott, Head of the NCA’s Prison and Lifetime Management Unit, said:\n“Offenders involved in organised crime groups so often think they can return to their criminal ventures once they are released from prison. But making them subject to Serious Crime Prevention Orders mean we will continue to monitor their activity and prevent them from engaging in further criminality.\n“These men were key players in organised immigration crime and their SCPOs mean they will be less attractive for recruitment to criminal groups, and even communicating with them will be risky.\n“Organised immigration crime remains a priority for the NCA and these orders show we will use all powers available to us to dismantle criminal gangs and prevent further harm to the people they exploit.\n”Orders are enforced by the NCA and action is taken against offenders who breach the terms of their orders."\nThe publication of orders is considered carefully and on a case by case basis. Those judged to meet the right criteria appear on the NCA website. Publishing data on criminals who are subject to these orders enables other organisations and the public to report breaches.\nAnyone with relevant information on the individuals named should contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.\n3 March 2025 ', 'date_time': 1741003200}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'NCA warning over money laundering linked to people smuggling', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/nca-warning-over-money-laundering-linked-to-people-smuggling', 'content': '\nNational Crime Agency officers have warned registered Hawaladars in the UK of the consequences of being involved in organised immigration crime.\nHawaladar systems serve entirely legitimate purposes, but are known to be exploited by criminals looking to move criminal cash, including from small boat people smuggling activity.Visits to 44 businesses across the UK were delivered by the NCA, in coordination with HMRC, over the course of two days, 25 and 26 February. They were also attended by officers from 9 forces – a show of joint commitment to increase intelligence on financial flows linked to those who facilitate and enable people smuggling.Hawala is a type of informal value transfer system that operates on a basis of transfer of value without actual movement of money. It relies heavily on trust – between hawaladars and their customers, and within the networks themselves.These systems are used for a wide variety of reasons – such as cheaper or faster money transmission, cultural preference, lack of confidence in banks, or because they are the only channel through which funds can be transmitted in certain conflict regions.In the UK, they are subject to regulations and standards. They must be compliant with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations, and are legally required to report anything suspicious to the NCA.Those who do not do so risk criminal charges, heavy fines, business closures and severe reputational damage. Those who take payment from people smuggling activity, whether willingly or unwittingly, are helping to fuel a crime that endangers the lives of thousands.Last year, following a National Crime Agency investigation, Iranian hawaladar Asghar Gheshalghian was sentenced to eight years in jail after being convicted of running an unregistered money services business that served people smuggling networks.Gheshalghian acted as a trusted middleman, accepting payments from migrants or their families, and then releasing money to the criminal gangs following the completion of their journeys to the UK, charging a commission at the same time.This week’s activity was designed to emphasise the importance of vigilance, signpost reporting mechanisms and warn all those working in the sector that a failure to comply with legislation will result in serious consequences. It will be paired with further activity over the coming months.Alex Murray, Director Threat Leadership at the National Crime Agency, said:“Organised immigration crime is a deadly threat that led to more than 70 fatalities in the Channel last year alone. Criminal gangs are behind these crossings.“The National Crime Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into people smuggling networks, and we are determined to do all we can to target those involved – including those who enable, support and financially benefit from this criminal activity.“Money service businesses provide an important service, and the vast majority are compliant with regulation.“However, it is absolutely key that all those who work in this sector remain vigilant, report suspicious activity, and play their part to stop this horrific crime.“Those who don’t will be pursued and prosecuted as harshly as those directly involved in organising the crossings.”Louise MacDonald, Deputy Director of Economic Crime, at HMRC’S Fraud Investigation Service, said:“Businesses who fail to comply with money laundering regulations leave themselves, and the UK economy, open to attacks by criminals, including those involved in organised immigration fraud.“We know many registered Hawaladars provide vital and legitimate services to scores of communities. That’s why we’re working with partners at the NCA to help protect them from criminals who would prey on their services, and we will use all our powers to tackle those who fail to meet their legal obligations.”Minister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said:“Law-abiding Hawaladars have a responsibility to report suspicious activity, and as this warning makes clear, we will not hesitate to prosecute those who enable people smugglers to profit from putting countless lives at risk.”“This government continues to combat organised immigration crime and tackling illicit finance is a priority as we work to secure the UK’s borders and deliver the Plan for Change.”\n27 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740657600}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Firearms and ammunition seized from SUV at Dover', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/firearms-and-ammunition-seized-from-suv-at-dover', 'content': '\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) has launched an investigation after 13 firearms and 300 rounds of ammunition were seized from a vehicle at Dover.\nBorder Force officers stopped and searched the SUV on Monday 24 February as it entered the UK from France.\nInside a custom-built hide in the vehicle’s footwell they discovered 13 firearms, including Skorpions, a submachine gun and pistols.\nThey also found 300 rounds of ammunition and five kilos of heroin.\nTests are ongoing to classify the weapons and verify if they are viable.\nKasha Sanderson, 39, of Wick, Bristol, appeared at Maidstone Magistrates’ Court yesterday (25 February) charged with importation of firearms, ammunition and Class A drugs.\nNCA Senior Investigating Officer Daren Nicholls said: “This is a significant seizure of deadly firearms that were destined for the UK criminal marketplace.\n“Our investigation to track down the organised criminals responsible for this attempted importation continues at pace.\n“Stopping the availability of firearms to UK-based criminals is a top priority for the NCA and we work closely with domestic and international partners to do this.”\n26 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740571200}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Man who downloaded child sexual abuse images as a teen is convicted', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-who-downloaded-child-sexual-abuse-images-as-a-teen-is-convicted', 'content': '\nAn east Londoner who was found with indecent images of children and was linked to an online criminal group that blackmailed young teenage girls has been convicted.\nThe National Crime Agency investigated Richard Ehiemere, from Hackney, now 21,\xa0after receiving a referral from Discord in January 2021, when he was 17 years old.\nThe online platform was concerned about the activities of the CVLT group, which Ehiemere was linked to.\nCVLT is a form of \'Com\' network, which are typically made up of young males who share harmful and misogynistic content, and commit a range of online offences.\nMembers attempt to gain status within the group by committing or encouraging ever more shocking or harmful acts.\nThe investigation into Ehiemere established that the online moniker "Retaliate#1337" had logged on to Discord channels connected to CVLT 383 times and disclosed stolen email addresses and passwords, known as \'combo lists\'. The profile is also believed to have shared indecent images of children (IIOC).\nNCA investigators were able to trace these log ons back to Ehiemere\'s home address in Hackney, where he was arrested in April 2021 with the assistance of the Metropolitan Police Service.\nHis mobile phone was seized and found to contain 29 IIOC, ranging from category A (the most severe) to category C. Conversations relating to hacking, selling unlawfully obtained material and how to avoid detection were also stored on it.\nA computer tower was found with 142 combo lists stored on it, each containing personal details which had been stolen and could have been used to defraud victims.\nA number of accounts and software associated with VPN providers – which are used to mask the user\'s location - such as "ExpressVPN", "NordVPN", "MullvadVPN" and "OpenVPN" were also found. "ExpressVPN" and "MullvadVPN" were used to access the relevant Retaliate account when emails and passwords were shared.\nMore broadly, CVLT member targeted\xa0girls on social media platforms such as Discord. They used online monikers to communicate and persuade them to send intimate photos of themselves.\nMembers threatened to \'dox\' their victims, which involves revealing real-world identities and publishing other personal information online, in order to coerce them into complying with their demands.\nCVLT victims would often be targeted by one member of the group who would persuade them to send intimate images of themselves, either by coercion or consent. This material would then be used by the wider group to blackmail the victim into sending increasingly extreme content.\nGirls were forced to join group calls, where they would be instructed to carry out sexual acts and acts of self-harm for their audience. In severe cases, vulnerable victims were encouraged to kill themselves on camera.\nEhiemere was charged with two fraud offences and three IIOC offences and convicted by a jury at Aldersgate Nightingale Court today (25 February), following a seven-day trial. He is due to be sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 1 May.\nSteve Laval, Senior Investigating Officer at the NCA\'s National Cyber Crime Unit, said:\n"Richard Ehiemere was a key enabler for this harmful online group, providing stolen data which they could use to defraud hundreds of victims.\n"Com networks like CVLT are dangerous online environments in which members encourage each other to commit a range of harmful and often depraved offences.\n"These networks are built on extremist or misogynistic ideologies and promote violence against women and girls, who are forced to comply with their extreme demands through fear.\n"The NCA and policing are committed to reducing the threat caused by Com networks through working with industry to identify groups, pursuing their members or those linked to them, and removing harmful content, as well as raising awareness with parents and educators to help them spot deviant behaviour."\n\n25 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740484800}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'NCA investigation leads to conviction of gang who forced migrants to work in cannabis farms', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/nca-investigation-leads-to-conviction-of-gang-who-forced-migrants-to-work-in-cannabis-farms', 'content': '\nSix people have been convicted of being part of a crime group responsible for forcing trafficked migrants to work in cannabis farms.\nA National Crime Agency investigation identified that the ringleader of the gang, convicted people smuggler Mai Van Nguyen, 35, of Beetham Tower, Birmingham, was involved in the operation of a number of cannabis farms mainly throughout the Midlands, London and north of England.\nThe properties would be leased in other people’s identities using false identity documents or aliases.\nHe worked with fellow Vietnamese nationals Doung Dinh, 38, from Birmingham, and Nghia Dinh Tran, 24, from Lewisham, London, to exploit migrants by putting them to work.\nA trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard how Shamraiz Akhtar and Tasawar Hussain, both 50 and from Birmingham, were taxi drivers who would move migrants around various properties for the gang, being paid hundreds of pounds a time.\nOn occasion they would also transport cannabis or equipment for the farms.\nA sixth member of the gang, Amjad Nawaz, 43, from Birmingham, acted as a middleman, and was in regular conversations with Nguyen about workers, the buying and selling of cannabis, and arranging for properties to be used in Birmingham.\n\nNguyen, Dinh, Tran, Akhtar, Hussain & Nawaz\nTheir trial heard from a victim of trafficking, named only as ‘Witness Z’, a Vietnamese national who was exploited by the gang after arriving in the UK by boat in November 2020.\nHe initially travelled to the UK to pay off money he had borrowed to fund medical treatment for his wife, and was given a phone number to call by his traffickers when he arrived.\nAfter being processed by the immigration authorities was driven from London to Birmingham, before being put to work in a cannabis grow in nearby Tipton, West Midlands.\nWitness Z said he had no choice but to work as he was in debt bondage to the people who had transported him to the UK.\nLater he was taken to the site of another cannabis grow in Tyseley, Birmingham, where he was forced to help clear up the property. NCA officers would later find messages on Nguyen’s phone from Nawaz, complaining that the landlord was angry about the state it had been left in.\nWitness Z was then transported to another cannabis farm at a house in Hartlepool, Teesside. This was raided by Cleveland Police in June 2021 and Witness Z was arrested.\nInside the property officers found a note pinned to a bedroom door saying “take what you want, please don’t hit me, I do not know English”, and a hand-written diary extract from a migrant in which they ask “why did I get beaten up and forced to work?”\nNawaz was arrested by the NCA at his partner’s house in Hall Green on 7 June 2021.

Four Vietnamese migrants were found inside.\nAkhtar was initially detained by West Midlands Police officers, who were working with the NCA, in March 2021. He was returning from a cannabis grow in Cheshire at the time, and 10 kilos of the drug was found in his car. He was arrested again by the NCA at his home in Nechells Park Road, Birmingham in November 2021.\nDinh was arrested at his partner’s address in Essex Street, Birmingham in August 2022.\nBy this time Mai Van Nguyen had already been detained in Liverpool, where he was visiting his girlfriend, in connection with a separate plot to smuggle migrants into the UK in the back of HGVs.

All six denied charges of trafficking for exploitation.\nOn Monday 24 February, following a seven-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court, all six men were found guilty of all charges.\nThey were remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Friday 4 July.\nNCA Branch Commander Kevin Broadhead said: “These men were responsible for the exploitation of a number of migrants who they moved around the UK and forced to work in cannabis farms.\n“Not only were the migrants transported to the UK in incredibly dangerous ways in lorries or in boats, but they were then made to live in degrading conditions in order to pay off their debt bondage. We know some were also subjected to violence.\n“But this gang didn’t care about that, they only saw the migrants as a way to make money.\n“Tackling organised immigration crime is a priority for the NCA, and it is cases like this that demonstrate exactly why.”\nThroughout the course of the NCA investigation cannabis farms linked to the network were found in Tipton, Coventry and Edgbaston in the West Midlands, Derby, Hartlepool, East Ham in London and Gatley in Cheshire.

NCA investigators believe he was likely behind dozens of cross-Channel journeys.NCA surveillance officers watched Jameel met one such client, Albanian national Artan Halilaj, 39, in Perry Barr, Birmingham on 1 September 2023.A handover of cash took place, and shortly afterwards Jameel made a phone call in which he was heard to say that he had “my three passengers, all good to go, all okay”.Artan Halilaj, who was at the time living in Southall, had himself arrived on a small boat from Belgium earlier that year. He claimed asylum, but disappeared from the hotel where he was supposed to be staying as his claim was processed by the Home Office.Artan was organising passage for his relative Fiorentino Halilaj, 25, who crossed the Channel in a small boat the next day on 2 September. His phone was taken into the possession of the immigration authorities, but it was later handed to the NCA. It was found to contain a contact for Jameel.Pictured: Pistiwan Jameel, Artan Halilaj and Fiorentino Halilaj\nOver the following days NCA officers were able to record his side of a number of conversations Jameel had with criminal associates, in which he arranged crossings for his customers, often referring to migrants as ‘pigeons’ or ‘sticks’. On one occasion he complained that competition in the people smuggling market was driving prices down, while bragging that he had made at least two million US dollars for his criminal networks through his contacts.Another conversation suggested that he was involved in moving a migrant to Turkey from the Middle East, and expected to earn around ten thousand US dollars from the enterprise.Artan and Jameel were arrested by NCA officers on 23 October 2023, while Fiorentino was arrested the following day at the immigration detention centre where he was being held.Jameel’s phone was found to contain information and messages relating to up to 50 people who had entered the UK illegally on small boats during 2022 and 2023, including images taken on boats in the Channel.Artan and Fiorentino Halilaj were both charged with one count of facilitating illegal immigration, while Jameel was charged with two counts.Jameel and Fiorentino both pleaded guilty, while Artan was convicted on 12 November 2024 following a week-long trial at Birmingham Crown Court.Today (Monday 24 February) at the same court Jameel was sentenced to four years and ten months in prison, Artan Halilaj was jailed for three-and-a-half years, while Fiorentino Halilaj got two-and-a-half years.The NCA’s investigation was supported by Immigration Enforcement Criminal and Financial Investigations and Border Force.NCA Branch Commander Kevin Broadhead said:\xa0“The scale of Pistiwan Jameel’s offending was likely far wider than just the crossings he was charged over. The information we uncovered during our investigation suggests he was prolific, and was operating over a considerable amount of time.“The way in which he talked about the people he was smuggling and the profits he was making demonstrated he was only in it for the money. He was quite happy to risk other people’s lives in flimsy boats at sea as long as he got paid.“Targeting smugglers like him is a priority for the NCA, and we will do all we can to disrupt and dismantle the organised criminal networks involved.”The NCA is currently leading around 70 investigations into individuals or networks involved in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking, using a full range of tactics to target them.\n24 February 2025 ', 'date_time': 1740398400}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Man who fled to Spain after being charged with small boat people smuggling convicted', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-who-fled-to-spain-after-being-charged-with-small-boat-people-smuggling-convicted', 'content': '\nAn Albanian man who went on the run to Spain to avoid standing trial for people smuggling offences has been sentenced after being extradited back to the UK.\nNational Crime Agency officers started an investigation into Arsen Feci, 49, from Nottingham, and his organised crime group after a coastguard plane saw migrants being offloaded from a RHIB, named Orca, in Joss Bay, Kent in the early hours of 9 October 2022.\nFeci, alongside Banet Tershana, Klodian Shenaj, Jetmir Myrtaj and British national Desmond Rice, used the same location for a second crossing on 23 October of the same year.\n\nThroughout the events, Feci was in constant contact with Shenaj and Rice, meeting Rice on 12 October as he arranged to buy a second RHIB named Aquaholic. Rice then transported the boat from Poole to Brightlingsea Marina.\nInvestigators found Feci was responsible for purchasing equipment for the crossing, with CCTV showing him purchasing maintenance items from Halfords, and sourcing ‘staff’ to carry out the crossings.\nOn 22 October, Feci was under surveillance as he travelled back to Brightlingsea with Rice and Shenaj.\nThe group were having issues with the seaworthiness of the boat, however, which appeared to delay their attempts and the boat was moored away from the main marina.\nFeci was in conversation with Shenaj and Rice.

They were then hidden in a load of used tyres ahead of being driven from France to Zeebrugge in Belgium where they would have been loaded onto a ferry to Purfleet, England.\nNCA investigators believe they were charged in the region of £15,000 each for their passage to the UK.\nHowever, the Belgian authorities, who were working with the NCA to track the lorry, were able to move in and intercept the trailer at a parking area in Gentbrugge, Belgium, before it was able to board the boat.\nThe NCA investigation found that Nolan, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was responsible for sourcing a driver for the journey and arranged for McLaughlin to travel from Scotland to Kent to pick up an HGV and take a ferry to France to drive the migrants from their pick-up point and across Europe.\nThroughout the trip, McLaughlin remained in contact with Nolan to ensure that the migrants were collected on time.\nWayne Sherlock, 44, from Dover, Kent, was another gang member who was convicted for his role in the conspiracy in June 2020 and received a four-year prison sentence following a trial at Maidstone Crown Court.\nLoughran worked with Sherlock to arrange for an HGV tractor unit to be moved from Ireland to Kent on 4 March 2020, ready to be used in the smuggling attempt the following day.\nMessages between the group showed detailed planning including routes, logistics and how the migrants should enter and hide in the vehicle.

They were working on Operation Venetic – the UK response to the takedown of encrypted communications platform EncroChat.\nOn the platform, Donovan, of Walsingham Road, Liverpool, was known by the handle “Astralcleaner”.\nHe played a key role in the supply of Class A drugs and co-ordinated the collection, storage and laundering of the OCG’s money – between £10m and £13m – in cash through third party business accounts.\nAlmost every single door in his house was specially reinforced when NCA officers arrested him.\nA digital review of Donovan’s devices revealed images of a spreadsheet detailing money owed by and to him, as well as multiple messages indicating the scale of the cash collection, and his interest in the packaging of money.\nThis included: “3,424,000 owed in eng”; “934000 all got it now to come off bill”; “200 + 9 for 4.5%”, a reference to a delivery of £200,000, plus a commission of 4.5% (£9,000); and a note about a wodge of £50 notes, which were “zipped up and tied at the top”.\nNCA officers discovered EncroChat conversations and images revealing that Donovan had also played a significant role in the supply of class A drugs to the UK.\nIn discussions with other organised criminals, he asked for “any news on far ones” (container ships transporting cocaine), and haggled over the price of “botts” and “tops” – references to kilogram quantities of heroin and cocaine.\nIn January he admitted conspiracy to supply 23.7 kilos of cocaine, one kilo of heroin and money laundering of between £10 - £13million.\nFour other men also admitted their roles in the OCG.\nTwo weeks ago, on the eve of his trial, the final OCG member Christopher Roper, 41, of Allerton Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to money laundering.\nRoper would often store criminal cash where he worked, at a well-known garage, the Wavertree Car Centre.\nRoper was also on EncroChat as “sentientwolf” and would use the platform – which offenders believed was impenetrable - to arrange the transfers of cash, for which he sometimes received a 4.5% fee.\nAccomplice James Vaughan, 38, of Green Lane, Liverpool, was previously on the NCA’s Most Wanted fugitives list.\nHe was arrested as part of the investigation in 2020 and officers found more than £2,000 at his home along with two Rolex watches, a Bulgari watch and packaging for a cash counting machine.\nBut he fled to Spain where he was eventually traced and arrested and extradited last year.\nEvidence showed that Donovan would have cash delivered to Roper, who would arrange the payment of it into third party business accounts.

This enabled criminals to bypass multifactor authentication on online banking and telecoms platforms, allowing them to access accounts and complete fraudulent transactions.\nAn elite plan cost £380 per month, which offered both a bespoke \'free text to speech\' service, where criminals could type any message they wanted an automated call to say, and pre-scripted calls specifically designed by Picari, Vijayasidhurshan and Siddeeque to target customers.

Zada used video testimonials of those he’d successfully smuggled to promote himself.Two other men, Dilshad Shamo and Ali Khdir from Caerphilly in South Wales, also used social media apps to publicise their people smuggling enterprise. They were convicted in November and await sentence.Sophie Austin, Operations Manager at the NCA’s Online Communication Centre, said:“Social media remains a key way the organised crime groups involved in people smuggling promoting their illegal services to migrants. It is a major part of their business model.“Once migrants are engaged they then move conversations onto encrypted messaging apps where they are hidden from law enforcement.“Taking down these accounts disrupts the activities of those criminal networks, we are devoting more resources to doing that as it is one of a number of ways we can actively target them and make their life more difficult.“We continue to work closely with social media platforms to highlight such content and contribute to the development of detection capabilities.“As a result, our partnership with them has seen a significant increase in the number of accounts we have identified and taken down in the last year – up more than 40 per cent since the end of 2023.”The social media action plan was implemented in December 2021 to bring greater collaboration against those crime groups using social media to recruit, communicate and advertise a range of illegal services.It sees a greater shared understanding of the threat from organised immigration crime between social media companies and the NCA, as well as a more streamlined, two-way system of communication.Tackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we continue to use the full suite of powers at our disposal to disrupt networks through targeting their social media offerings, financial flows and their supply routes for boats, engines and maritime equipment.\n27 January 2025 ', 'date_time': 1737979200}, {'source': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'title': 'Wigan man who sexually abused young girl is sentenced', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/wigan-man-who-sexually-abused-young-girl-is-sentenced', 'content': '\nA man who made images of himself sexually assaulting a young girl and then distributed them online has been jailed.\nGareth Vickers, 45, from Wigan, was identified by National Crime Agency investigators after the FBI monitored his sexually explicit conversations on the Kik online chat platform.\nChat logs showed that Vickers, using the online pseudonym \'daddyv230304\', shared photos of the girl in knickers and a training bra and said that he was sexually aroused.\n\nThe images he shared became increasingly explicit and ended with some showing him exposing the girl\'s genitals.\nVickers was arrested by NCA officers at his home address in April last year, after which he said "I was at my lowest."\nForensic examination of his devices showed he\'d searched the internet for teen porn terms and had used TOR, which allows anonymous browsing and access to the dark web.

Smoke can be seen coming from the rear of the vessel.\nThe group also conspired with three associates: Ronald Scott, Toby Lake and Stephen Chapman. Chapman was living in France, and acted as the point of contact overseas.\nLawrence was seen buying the vessel from a boat yard on the Norfolk Broads for £30,000, enlisting Baigent to acquire it for him. Baigent ignored advice from the seller to transport it by road, and instead, the boat was skippered from Norfolk to Dover by Lawrence and Scott.\nScott, Lake and Chapman were arrested shortly before the final attempt to set sail and prosecuted by French law enforcement, who were acting on information provided by the NCA\'s case team. They were sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, one year imprisonment, and two years imprisonment respectively.\nDuring that last attempt, French police conducting surveillance near Wimereux, a coastal town between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, spotted the Sorel Light about 100 metres from the beach.\nThey saw 12 people of Vietnamese origin arriving on foot at a car park in the town, who then split into several groups before gathering on the beach.\nFlashes of light were seen emanating from the Sorel Light, with return signals coming from the migrants. Some of them entered the water and swam towards the boat to try and get on board, at which point the French authorities intervened.\nChapman jumped into the sea and attempted to swim away but was apprehended. Meanwhile, the person piloting the boat moved it away at speed, causing a number of French officers to fall off a ladder and into the water.\nThe police eventually caught up with the vessel and detained the people on board. There were 11 Vietnamese migrants, together with Lake and Scott. The twelfth migrant had fallen into the water and was also detained.\nThe UK-based group relied on pure chance rather than navigational experience, attempting to follow cross-channel ferries en-route to France. All the crossing attempts happened in the days before the arrests in France - from Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate. None were successful due to repeated mechanical issues with the boats.\nWhen the Sorel Light\'s engine failed, Lawrence borrowed a smaller \'Piscator\' boat from a breakage yard in Hollingbourne, Kent, which itself had to be towed back to the UK following an attempted trip to France after it ran out of fuel.\nHe tried to hide his criminality by using eight pay-as-you-go phones telephones, unregistered vehicles and cash payments made via third parties. He would also use his associates\' phones and leave his at unrelated locations in an attempt to stay under the radar of law enforcement.\nLawrence is a career criminal with 15 previous convictions between 1981 and 2024 for offences including supplying cocaine, producing class B drugs, ABH, burglary, and common assault. He is currently serving a three-year prison sentence after being convicted of supplying class A drugs and money laundering in 2024.\nHe was arrested alongside Baigent and Giglia in October 2018 and all three were charged with assisting unlawful immigration in May 2022.\nLawrence pleaded guilty at Canterbury Crown Court on 24 October 2024, with Giglia and Baigent convicted at the same court on 14 and 15 November 2024 respectively.\nAt the same court today (17 January), Lawrence was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years imprisonment, Baigent to three years nine months imprisonment and Giglia to three years and four months imprisonment.\n\nRonald Scott and Paul Giglia untying Sorel Light at Dover Marina\nNCA senior investigating officer Steven Ahmet said: \n"Although this was an amateurish criminal enterprise the intention was clear – to smuggle vulnerable migrants to the UK using ramshackle vessels.\n"These journeys would have put lives in peril as Lawrence and his accomplices, who between them had little sailing experience, were navigating through one of the world\'s busiest shipping lanes.\n"Their primary motivation was financial gain and they had no regard for the lives of the people they intended to transport.\n"Working with our French partners we were able to put a stop the plot, dismantle the crime group and bring them to justice.\n"We are determined to destroy the criminal networks behind organised immigration crime, and pursue every option available to save lives."\nMinister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said: \n"We are determined to protect our borders by taking down the unscrupulous people smuggling gangs who prey on vulnerable people and fuel dangerous and illegal journeys.\n"These callous criminals put several lives on the line and their vile scheme could have easily ended in tragedy.\n"I\'d like to thank the skilled prosecutors and investigators involved for their tireless work to identify, disrupt and bring to justice these people-smugglers who abused our borders and put lives at risk.\n"As part of this government\'s Plan for Change, we are ensuring those who participate in this evil trade and threaten our security will face the full force of the law."\nGiorgina Venturella, Specialist Prosecutor for the CPS, said: \n"These defendants were involved in a conspiracy which attempted to illegally smuggle people across the channel from France.

When we said we would dismantle the gangs behind this evil trade, and disrupt their supply chains, this was exactly what we meant.\n"Just seven weeks ago, as part of the Government’s Plan for Change, I signed the UK\'s landmark deal on law enforcement cooperation and border security with Iraq and met with the Kurdish Regional Government, signalling our determination to work together to dismantle the criminal smuggling gangs operating through that region.\n"Our security agreement with Iraq is already showing its impact. By sharing the expertise of our Border Security Command, enhancing intelligence-sharing, and providing additional funding to support Iraq’s law enforcement capabilities, we are able to target the people smuggling gangs at source.\n"The criminal gangs operating through Iraq and the KRI do not respect borders or jurisdictions, which is why it is imperative that the UK continues to work closely with the Government of Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government to coordinate our enforcement efforts and resources, and cooperate on investigations like this one."\nTackling organised immigration crime remains a key priority for the NCA, and we are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before.\nThe Agency has around 70 ongoing investigations into networks or individuals in the top tier of organised immigration crime or human trafficking, those inflicting the highest harm, and who are the most difficult to reach.

They were found guilty of drug supply offences following a three-week trial in November 2024.\xa0\nMichal Stanislawczuk, 39, also known by his EncroChat handles \'Sizabelarm\' and \'Polishshaman\', was jailed for 12 years for his role as a chef, which included an unsuccessful attempt to extract cocaine dissolved in 37 litres of oil.\nAnother of the gang\'s chefs, 38-year-old David Brierley, produced amphetamine and was unmasked as the user behind EncroChat handle \'Kingchef-uk\'. He was jailed for 12 years and six months.\nSafdar Pervez, 57, is a taxi driver who moonlighted as a trusted courier for the criminal network and operated under perceived darkness behind his \'Satanicgate\' EnroChat handle.\nFor his role ferrying large quantities of drugs and tens of thousands of pounds across the north of England, Pervez was jailed for 11 years.\nOne of his regular trips was to County Durham to deliver kilos of diluted cocaine to 39-year-old Daryll Hall, one of O\'Flaherty\'s top customers.\nHall was sentenced to 15 years in his absence having absconded before the start of November\'s trial. Work to locate him and bring him into custody is ongoing.\n\n(From L-R:\xa0David Brierley,\xa0Michal Stanislawczuk,\xa0Daryll Hall,\xa0Safdar Pervez)\nNCA investigators unravelled the drugs conspiracy after a fist-sized bag of cocaine and an EncroChat handset were seized from ex-footballer Paul Shepherd\'s car April 2020.\nHis house was searched and officers discovered a Glock pistol, a bolt-action sniper rifle and 213 rounds of ammunition. Shepherd was jailed for over nine years in 2023.\nEncroChat data showed that O\'Flaherty had directed Shepherd to store the firearms at his address and move the cocaine found in his car.\nAnd further analysis uncovered the crime group\'s business model.\nWhile the amphetamine was produced by "chefs" Stanislawczuk and Brierley on-site at properties in Leeds and Bradford, high purity cocaine was purchased three kilos at a time for £123,000.\nIt would then be diluted with cheap chemicals and resold as four kilos for £150,000 to dealers one step down the supply chain, such as Hall.\nNCA Operations Manager Nigel Coles said:\xa0"Our complex and extensive investigation has brought down every member of this dangerous criminal network, from the mastermind behind the conspiracy to couriers transporting both firearms and drugs across the north of England.\n"Lengthy custodial sentences have been given to all the ten members of this organised crime group and the investigation has stopped significant quantities of harmful drugs reaching our communities, together with the seizure of deadly firearms.\n"At the NCA we are committed to our mission of protecting the public from serious and organised crime, and in dismantling this network we have made our communities a safer place to live."\n ', 'date_time': 1744334472}, {'source': 'austrac', 'title': '\n\tEnhancing AUSTRAC Online: Your feedback in action', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/enhancing-austrac-online-your-feedback-action', 'content': '\nAUSTRAC is planning an online security upgrade that will change how you log onto AUSTRAC Online.

I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land and their unbroken connection to country.\xa0\nI also acknowledge past and future leaders. As a Wiradjuri man I am proud to be living purposefully, serving the Australian community.\nI’m proud of AUSTRAC’s role in working towards safeguarding our community, preventing crime and ensuring we have a secure financial system and businesses that can operate on a crime-free level playing field.\nBut we can’t take our eyes off the ball on this. Criminal ingenuity never ceases to amaze me and some industries, like the gambling industry, are frequently at the coalface of criminal infiltration.\xa0\nToday I want to talk to you about preventing your business from being exploited by criminals. I know everyone here wants to run a legitimate business and provide a successful product, but many criminals are a step ahead of you and if you let your guard down, they will get in.\nImagine running a multi-million dollar business and having little knowledge or interest in the legal obligations you’re expected to adhere to. Imagine running a business and not investing in the money laundering controls needed to protect that business from crime. Or worse, imagine running a business that relies on dirty money and turning a blind eye to crimals infiltrating that business, for the benefit of profit. It might sound hard to believe but these are some of the failings AUSTRAC has observed in the gambling sector. This is no way to run a legitimate and sustainable business.\nSerious and organised crime costs Australia more than 68 billion dollars a year - that’s according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. We all have role to play in stamping out illegal activity and preventing the harm it’s causing the community. And it is causing harm. Money-laundering funds are generated by the very worst criminal behaviour and those funds are reinvested back into that behaviour, creating a thriving criminal underworld.\nThe value of the domestic illicit drug market alone is worth at least $12.4 billion dollars per year.\xa0Not only that, we estimate tax fraud to range from between $1.8 and $6.3b a year, more than $2b in scam proceeds. – All this money then needs to be laundered through the Australian economy, every single year. Australia is also a very attractive place for international money laundering syndicates to launder proceeds of foreign crime also.\xa0\nThe people who do that are persistent, innovative and professional. Not only do we deal with international crime networks but we are dealing with international money laundering organisations. That is, criminal organisations that just specialise in money laundering. They bid against each other for work\xa0and they consistently look for holes in our regulatory controls so they can launder money through them.\xa0\nThat’s why we are tireless in ensuring businesses are alert to their risks and have effective and working controls in place. AUSTRAC has a dual remit: we are Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator as well as Australia’s financial intelligence unit. We play an integral role in safeguarding the Australian community and the economy. But so do you.\xa0\nYour suspicious matter reporting and know your customer processes help us detect, deter and disrupt serious and organised crime, so that we can build resilience against criminal exploitation in legitimate businesses and financial markets.\xa0\nThe challenges to the gambling industry include the digitisation of currency, financial systems that are more dispersed and complex, the need for more sophisticated customer verification processes, and competition from other players in a rapidly evolving online sector.\nAll these things put your businesses under pressure. But if you don’t take your obligations seriously, if you don’t look out for the gaps where the dirty money can get in, the criminals will exploit you. And that’s what I want to talk to you about today.\nI’ve been the CEO of AUSTRAC for just over a year and I’m so proud of the work we’ve done in that time to reduce harm in the community. While we’ve been working with industry and our reporting entities to reduce that harm, AUSTRAC is not in the business of continuous education without action.\xa0\nIt’s important that businesses understand their legal obligations because I'm prepared to take strong and swift action where it's warranted.\nThere's no question about where the funds come from and how those funds are impacting Australians. There’s the crime that led to the profits in the first place – and the reinvestment of those profits into more crime. At the worst end of the scale we’re talking about drugs, scams, child exploitation and significant amounts of human trafficking. So if you are operating a gambling business you’ve got a pretty big responsibility.\nAUSTRAC uses a range of regulatory tools and powers to promote compliance and we tailor our approach based on the level of risk posed by the entities we regulate and their circumstances in their industry.\xa0\nIn some cases we can focus on education, or collaboration with a business. Or if a business publicly recognises its deficiencies and shows a commitment to addressing the issues, AUSTRAC may accept an enforceable undertaking as we have in the gambling industry.\xa0\nSometimes a campaign targeting a specific sector, is needed. A couple of years ago, AUSTRAC launched a corporate bookmaker campaign focusing on some of the largest online bookmakers in Australia. We found that many of the bookmakers had only a basic understanding of their money laundering risks, and because of that, they didn’t have appropriate controls in place to identify or manage those risks.\xa0\nAs a result of the lack of controls, we found a number of customers had gambled with illegally obtained money. For example we found financial advisers using other people’s money to fund their gambling habits. But thanks to that campaign, there are now better systems and controls in place at a number of bookmakers and this dodgy activity, which clearly harms the community, is far more likely to be detected and reported to AUSTRAC.\xa0\nWith cases where we find serious non-compliance, we will apply for a civil penalty and as you can see in recent years, court action has led to some significant fines. So AUSTRAC is more than happy to work in cooperation with businesses that are doing the right thing, but because of the harm that money laundering and organised crime causes the community, it can require us to take that kind of swift action.\nI’ll state the obvious here: there’s a significant risk of money laundering in the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe launched our Money Laundering National Risk Assessment last year. If you read it you would have seen our assessment of the gambling sector. Casinos pose a high money laundering risk and betting agencies, corporate bookmakers, and pubs and clubs are assessed as posing a medium risk for money laundering.\nDespite sustained regulatory and law enforcement efforts, casinos continue to be exploited for large-scale money laundering – and that’s because they are exposed to a wide range of vulnerabilities and aspects of their operating models make them very attractive to criminals.\nCasino risks come as no surprise to anyone here. But some of the issues we’re seeing across the sector in other businesses include:\n\nAnonymous individuals and high-value customers who are continuing to launder money through gambling services.\nIndividuals and organised criminals that are both domestic and international.\xa0\nA significant number of cash transactions, as large sums of money can be moved in a short period of time through some gaming activities.\xa0\nOnline gaming services that are highly accessible and limit face to face interaction which means less opportunity to generate behavioural suspicion.\xa0\n\nAUSTRAC has recently taken strong action against gambling companies where the risk has been large and the responsibility has been negligent. We’ve had successful court proceedings against Crown’s casinos and Sky City. Legal action is currently underway against Star and Entain.\xa0\nRemediation is a big job and will continue to be a big job for these businesses, which are now operating under much more stringent regulatory supervision as well as a public spotlight. But we can all learn from what went wrong.\xa0\nI want to share some of the findings from our recent enforcement action.\nIn several cases, we've seen clear examples of boards and executives turning a blind eye to crime for the benefit of profit. A key failure that we have observed is when boards take a “tick and flick” approach to their AML responsibilities. In these situations we have seen cultural failures where the important questions are just not asked, or the questions that are asked are not sufficiently robust.\xa0Ignorance may appear an easy way out for boards, but its certainly no excuse.\xa0\nYou just have to look at our civil proceedings against Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth - these concluded almost two years ago - to see examples of board failures.\xa0\nCrown continued a business relationship with a major casino junket operator until 2021, even though it was aware of allegations the operator was connected to organised crime. When ordering Crown to pay a $450 million dollar penalty, Justice Michael Lee said that it was clear that senior management within Crown knew of the high risk posed by junkets.\nOver a period of a year and half there were 75 suspicious 'incidents' involving a total of around $23 million in cash, in a private gaming room which Crown Melbourne gave one casino junket operator exclusive access to.\nThere were also billions of dollars in transactions that Crown failed to appropriately monitor. We have since seen substantial and ongoing efforts undertaken by Crown to address\xa0these failings.\xa0\nPleasingly, Crown along with every other casino in Australia, is now part of AUSTRACs public private partnership, the Fintel Alliance Casino Working group, which works across the sector to surface criminality.\nThrough some of our other regulatory actions, we've seen instances where international organisations operating in Australia are not paying attention to Australian laws. I was in Paris a few weeks ago for a Financial Action Taskforce meeting and online gambling was one of the sectors that was raised. I’ve seen examples of international companies failing to understand the risks that exist in specific jurisdictions, and therefore failing to understand and comply with the laws of that country.\nWe identified one gambling business that had a related overseas company contracted to exercise many of its AML functions for all of its customers, regardless of whether they were in Australia, the UK, somewhere in Europe… you get the idea. A one-size fits all approach is not effective.\xa0\nAnother issue we've seen is companies outsourcing their money laundering responsibilities without follow up, which means these companies aren’t attuned to the risks that their products create, so they’re not mitigating those basic risks properly.\xa0\nWe’ve seen many examples of pubs and clubs using templates for their AML programs, but without tailoring the templates to their specific business. When we asked some of those pubs and clubs about the details of their programs, they were actually surprised by some of the risks listed, or the controls that were meant to be put in place, under their own program. They had no idea about the finer details, they just ticked the box that they had a program in place.\xa0\nSo the message here is that you can outsource the development of your program, or use a template, but it is your responsibility to ensure it is tailored to your business and reflects your systems and controls. You can outsource the work, but you can’t outsource your legal liability. When we look at these examples, there are lessons to be taken from them.\xa0\nWe are happy to educate people about what we expect to see, but we do expect businesses and their boards to take responsibility for their money laundering programs.\xa0\nIf you have the idea that AUSTRAC will continuously educate and educate and educate and then maybe take action years later - you are mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think your business is too small to take responsibility for compliance – you are also mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think AUSTRAC won’t take further action against you because it has done so before – you are again mistaken.\nYour services and the gambling industry have been subject to this regime for many years now. It is your responsibility to comply with the law.\nEach business needs a tailored approach to compliance based on individual systems and processes and the only way you will meet your compliance obligations is to have a thorough understanding of how criminal activity can infiltrate your specific business.\xa0\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re running a small or large company – we’ve seen significant laundering risks in companies of all sizes. But when it comes to the bigger operators, the harms are greater, because the scale of the harm is magnified.\xa0\nI also want to caution those businesses we have worked with, or that have been subject to regulatory action, against reverting back to risky old ways of operating. We often see businesses letting old practices start to seep back and risk appetites starting to increase after a couple of years. We’d rather see businesses adapt their business model, like the casinos I’ve just mentioned, and remain compliant.\xa0\nOne point that I’d like to highlight, is that many legitimate gambling businesses still need to come to terms with the fact they can’t run a business on ill gotten gains. In some cases this has meant losing a large chunk of revenue that is never coming back.\nTake Crown, Sky City and Star casinos for example – state government controls mean the junkets aren’t returning and the controls put in place to allow them to operate are rigorous, more so than any other gambling business. To be successful and sustainable casinos have needed to reassess their business models.\nThe Crown Resorts group is probably the furthest ahead in this respect. Crown Sydney was designed as a VIP facility but without the junkets, and with the tighter requirements for enhanced customer due diligence they have had to change their business model in response, diversifying their entertainment offerings and focus.\nWe’re pleased to say that Crown has strengthened a number of its systems following AUSTRAC action. They include significantly increasing the resourcing of its AML function, investing in new systems to undertake transaction monitoring and implementing new procedures to better understand the source of their customers’ funds.\xa0\nWe don’t want to just sit on these lessons, we want you to have the best understanding possible. In the past, we have put out information about the lessons learned and we will continue to do so, to close the loop. When we complete some of the bigger enforcement actions that are underway we will share what we learned with our reporting entities so businesses can understand what went wrong and what we expect from them going forward.\nWell that brings us to the question ‘what does the future look like for AUSTRAC?’ I can tell you that the gambling sector is still a focus industry this year.\nOne of the biggest challenges is the gambling sector’s growth and diversification, especially in online gambling. While we have our eyes on the big players, our intelligence division is also watching some of those smaller offshore operators providing illegal scam based platforms.\xa0\nWe’re seeing a rise in so called “scambling”, where unlicensed online gambling platforms advertise on social media and trick people to visit a scam website to participate in gambling. Players are then asked to deposit funds into a PayID but it’s highly unlikely they will ever see their winnings from these sites. This ruse is also being used as a means to launder money from other criminal activities.\nThis is a real example of harm being done to the community, especially to our most vulnerable people, including people in remote and regional Aboriginal communities. The AUSTRAC led Fintel Alliance is working with police, banks and other industry partners to raise awareness of this issue, and try to minimise the harm being done.\xa0\nThe methods used by criminals to launder their dirty money are constantly changing, but AUSTRAC is evolving to meet these challenges.\nThe agency is going through its biggest change in nearly 20 years, as a result of the anti-money laundering reforms that passed the parliament late last year. AUSTRAC currently regulates around 17,000 businesses but that will rise to more than 100,000 as we bring tranche 2 entities, such as real estate agents, accountants and lawyers, under the legislation.\xa0\nThese reforms mean we will have many more touchpoints in the community and we are going to be closing and disrupting many more gaps that organised crime is out to exploit.\nOur staffing, systems and infrastructure is expanding in line with this bigger remit and so too are our intelligence and enforcement capabilities.\nAUSTRAC might be taking a more front foot approach to known risks but we are equally keen to raise standards, work cooperatively with businesses, and educate in the first instance. We are preparing to engage much more with you and we want to see compliance cultures embedded across the industry to prevent exploitation of the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe will work with you to ensure your businesses aren’t leaving the door open to criminal infiltration, which harms the Australian community and, at the end of the day, damages the legitimacy and sustainability of your business and your industry.\xa0\nSo my message is this: don’t turn a blind eye to your legal obligations. Protect the community by protecting your business and we will work together to detect, deter and disrupt illegal activities.

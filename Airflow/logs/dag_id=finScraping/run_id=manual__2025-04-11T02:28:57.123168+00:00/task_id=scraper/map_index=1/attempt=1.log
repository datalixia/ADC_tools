Over time, his smaller transactions added up to nearly $200,000 in illicit funds, which he unknowingly converted into digital currency for criminals.\nCases like these highlight the need for digital currency exchanges to understand the risks and common signs of suspicious activity involving cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs.\xa0\nThis is also why AUSTRAC recently launched a taskforce to ensure crypto ATMs providers comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws to help keep the community safe.\nHow can I prevent crimes like this\nDigital currency exchanges play an important role in protecting our community from serious and organised crime.\xa0To do your part:\n\nreport suspicious activity: if you suspect a person or transaction is linked to a crime, submit a suspicious matter report\nensure compliance: use resources for digital currency businesses to verify that your business has the right AML/CTF checks\xa0\nreport scams: if you believe you have come across a scam, report it to ScamWatch and the police\xa0\xa0\n\nFurther information\nFor more information, visit our What to know when using crypto ATMs page.\xa0\n\n', 'date_time': 1743390000, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tHarnessing data for a clearer picture of money laundering', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/harnessing-data-clearer-picture-money-laundering', 'content': '\nFintel Alliance’s Collaborative Analytics Hub aims to speed up the analysis of financial data, strengthen industry controls and support law enforcement.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nLate last year Fintel Alliance members came together in Sydney and Melbourne to collaborate on the\xa0Collaborative Analytics Hub’s first project. The project aimed to\xa0improve our intelligence picture of money laundering across the four major Australian banks – Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, NAB and Westpac.\nHow it worked\xa0 \xa0\nUnder notice, Fintel Alliance collected a dataset of over-the-counter and ATM cash deposits from the banks.\xa0In a first for AUSTRAC, the banks transferred files to AUSTRAC through a secure, shared digital channel.\n“This was a quicker and more streamlined way of moving large datasets than on previous projects,” said AUSTRAC Deputy CEO Intelligence Dr John Moss.\xa0\xa0\nOnce collected, AUSTRAC trialled commercial software with flexible and powerful capabilities to transform the massive dataset into visually engaging dashboards and models for analysis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nDrilling down on clusters of unusual deposit activity, AUSTRAC and the banks made further enquiries and shared their insights with each other to enrich the intelligence picture.\n“One such cluster resulted in the identification of a person of interest, whom we’ve since referred to law enforcement, who acted upon the referral within 24 hours” Dr Moss said.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nA valuable tool\xa0\n“The combined datasets and new software help us see things that were not immediately visible through our standard collection processes, or to any one industry partner.”\xa0\xa0\nDr Moss added that banking partners and law enforcement had positive feedback on the data analytics and dashboards developed.\xa0 \xa0\n“They’re a valuable tool to provide strategic and tactical insights on a range of areas for financial crime.”\xa0 \xa0\nAUSTRAC’s Intelligence Analytics team led the design and build of the dashboards, with support from data science experts from participating Fintel Alliance financial industry members.

However, we know that effective information sharing within and between businesses helps stop money laundering.”\nBusinesses and individuals covered by the AML/CTF legislation, including banks, casinos, remitters and money lenders, are now prohibited from disclosing certain information to another person (other than AUSTRAC), only where it would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice an investigation.\n“The move to a focus on harms strikes a better balance between protecting law enforcement investigations and allowing industry to collaborate in fighting money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes.”\nWhile the tipping off offence changes from today, most of the obligations under the amended AML/CTF Act will not come into effect until 2026, when entities in real estate, accounting, precious stones and metals and digital assets come under AUSTRAC’s remit.\nFurther information on the new offence is available on the AUSTRAC website.\n\n', 'date_time': 1743375600, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tAUSTRAC CEO, Brendan Thomas - Speaking notes at Regulating the Game 2025', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/our-recent-work/austrac-ceo-brendan-thomas-speaking-notes-regulating-game-2025', 'content': "\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today, here on Gadigal land.\xa0\nIf there are any elders present, I extend my respects to you. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land and their unbroken connection to country.\xa0\nI also acknowledge past and future leaders. As a Wiradjuri man I am proud to be living purposefully, serving the Australian community.\nI’m proud of AUSTRAC’s role in working towards safeguarding our community, preventing crime and ensuring we have a secure financial system and businesses that can operate on a crime-free level playing field.\nBut we can’t take our eyes off the ball on this. Criminal ingenuity never ceases to amaze me and some industries, like the gambling industry, are frequently at the coalface of criminal infiltration.\xa0\nToday I want to talk to you about preventing your business from being exploited by criminals. I know everyone here wants to run a legitimate business and provide a successful product, but many criminals are a step ahead of you and if you let your guard down, they will get in.\nImagine running a multi-million dollar business and having little knowledge or interest in the legal obligations you’re expected to adhere to. Imagine running a business and not investing in the money laundering controls needed to protect that business from crime. Or worse, imagine running a business that relies on dirty money and turning a blind eye to crimals infiltrating that business, for the benefit of profit. It might sound hard to believe but these are some of the failings AUSTRAC has observed in the gambling sector. This is no way to run a legitimate and sustainable business.\nSerious and organised crime costs Australia more than 68 billion dollars a year - that’s according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. We all have role to play in stamping out illegal activity and preventing the harm it’s causing the community. And it is causing harm. Money-laundering funds are generated by the very worst criminal behaviour and those funds are reinvested back into that behaviour, creating a thriving criminal underworld.\nThe value of the domestic illicit drug market alone is worth at least $12.4 billion dollars per year.\xa0Not only that, we estimate tax fraud to range from between $1.8 and $6.3b a year, more than $2b in scam proceeds. – All this money then needs to be laundered through the Australian economy, every single year. Australia is also a very attractive place for international money laundering syndicates to launder proceeds of foreign crime also.\xa0\nThe people who do that are persistent, innovative and professional. Not only do we deal with international crime networks but we are dealing with international money laundering organisations. That is, criminal organisations that just specialise in money laundering. They bid against each other for work\xa0and they consistently look for holes in our regulatory controls so they can launder money through them.\xa0\nThat’s why we are tireless in ensuring businesses are alert to their risks and have effective and working controls in place. AUSTRAC has a dual remit: we are Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator as well as Australia’s financial intelligence unit. We play an integral role in safeguarding the Australian community and the economy. But so do you.\xa0\nYour suspicious matter reporting and know your customer processes help us detect, deter and disrupt serious and organised crime, so that we can build resilience against criminal exploitation in legitimate businesses and financial markets.\xa0\nThe challenges to the gambling industry include the digitisation of currency, financial systems that are more dispersed and complex, the need for more sophisticated customer verification processes, and competition from other players in a rapidly evolving online sector.\nAll these things put your businesses under pressure. But if you don’t take your obligations seriously, if you don’t look out for the gaps where the dirty money can get in, the criminals will exploit you. And that’s what I want to talk to you about today.\nI’ve been the CEO of AUSTRAC for just over a year and I’m so proud of the work we’ve done in that time to reduce harm in the community. While we’ve been working with industry and our reporting entities to reduce that harm, AUSTRAC is not in the business of continuous education without action.\xa0\nIt’s important that businesses understand their legal obligations because I'm prepared to take strong and swift action where it's warranted.\nThere's no question about where the funds come from and how those funds are impacting Australians. There’s the crime that led to the profits in the first place – and the reinvestment of those profits into more crime. At the worst end of the scale we’re talking about drugs, scams, child exploitation and significant amounts of human trafficking. So if you are operating a gambling business you’ve got a pretty big responsibility.\nAUSTRAC uses a range of regulatory tools and powers to promote compliance and we tailor our approach based on the level of risk posed by the entities we regulate and their circumstances in their industry.\xa0\nIn some cases we can focus on education, or collaboration with a business. Or if a business publicly recognises its deficiencies and shows a commitment to addressing the issues, AUSTRAC may accept an enforceable undertaking as we have in the gambling industry.\xa0\nSometimes a campaign targeting a specific sector, is needed. A couple of years ago, AUSTRAC launched a corporate bookmaker campaign focusing on some of the largest online bookmakers in Australia. We found that many of the bookmakers had only a basic understanding of their money laundering risks, and because of that, they didn’t have appropriate controls in place to identify or manage those risks.\xa0\nAs a result of the lack of controls, we found a number of customers had gambled with illegally obtained money. For example we found financial advisers using other people’s money to fund their gambling habits. But thanks to that campaign, there are now better systems and controls in place at a number of bookmakers and this dodgy activity, which clearly harms the community, is far more likely to be detected and reported to AUSTRAC.\xa0\nWith cases where we find serious non-compliance, we will apply for a civil penalty and as you can see in recent years, court action has led to some significant fines. So AUSTRAC is more than happy to work in cooperation with businesses that are doing the right thing, but because of the harm that money laundering and organised crime causes the community, it can require us to take that kind of swift action.\nI’ll state the obvious here: there’s a significant risk of money laundering in the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe launched our Money Laundering National Risk Assessment last year. If you read it you would have seen our assessment of the gambling sector. Casinos pose a high money laundering risk and betting agencies, corporate bookmakers, and pubs and clubs are assessed as posing a medium risk for money laundering.\nDespite sustained regulatory and law enforcement efforts, casinos continue to be exploited for large-scale money laundering – and that’s because they are exposed to a wide range of vulnerabilities and aspects of their operating models make them very attractive to criminals.\nCasino risks come as no surprise to anyone here. But some of the issues we’re seeing across the sector in other businesses include:\n\nAnonymous individuals and high-value customers who are continuing to launder money through gambling services.\nIndividuals and organised criminals that are both domestic and international.\xa0\nA significant number of cash transactions, as large sums of money can be moved in a short period of time through some gaming activities.\xa0\nOnline gaming services that are highly accessible and limit face to face interaction which means less opportunity to generate behavioural suspicion.\xa0\n\nAUSTRAC has recently taken strong action against gambling companies where the risk has been large and the responsibility has been negligent. We’ve had successful court proceedings against Crown’s casinos and Sky City. Legal action is currently underway against Star and Entain.\xa0\nRemediation is a big job and will continue to be a big job for these businesses, which are now operating under much more stringent regulatory supervision as well as a public spotlight. But we can all learn from what went wrong.\xa0\nI want to share some of the findings from our recent enforcement action.\nIn several cases, we've seen clear examples of boards and executives turning a blind eye to crime for the benefit of profit. A key failure that we have observed is when boards take a “tick and flick” approach to their AML responsibilities. In these situations we have seen cultural failures where the important questions are just not asked, or the questions that are asked are not sufficiently robust.\xa0Ignorance may appear an easy way out for boards, but its certainly no excuse.\xa0\nYou just have to look at our civil proceedings against Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth - these concluded almost two years ago - to see examples of board failures.\xa0\nCrown continued a business relationship with a major casino junket operator until 2021, even though it was aware of allegations the operator was connected to organised crime. When ordering Crown to pay a $450 million dollar penalty, Justice Michael Lee said that it was clear that senior management within Crown knew of the high risk posed by junkets.\nOver a period of a year and half there were 75 suspicious 'incidents' involving a total of around $23 million in cash, in a private gaming room which Crown Melbourne gave one casino junket operator exclusive access to.\nThere were also billions of dollars in transactions that Crown failed to appropriately monitor. We have since seen substantial and ongoing efforts undertaken by Crown to address\xa0these failings.\xa0\nPleasingly, Crown along with every other casino in Australia, is now part of AUSTRACs public private partnership, the Fintel Alliance Casino Working group, which works across the sector to surface criminality.\nThrough some of our other regulatory actions, we've seen instances where international organisations operating in Australia are not paying attention to Australian laws. I was in Paris a few weeks ago for a Financial Action Taskforce meeting and online gambling was one of the sectors that was raised. I’ve seen examples of international companies failing to understand the risks that exist in specific jurisdictions, and therefore failing to understand and comply with the laws of that country.\nWe identified one gambling business that had a related overseas company contracted to exercise many of its AML functions for all of its customers, regardless of whether they were in Australia, the UK, somewhere in Europe… you get the idea. A one-size fits all approach is not effective.\xa0\nAnother issue we've seen is companies outsourcing their money laundering responsibilities without follow up, which means these companies aren’t attuned to the risks that their products create, so they’re not mitigating those basic risks properly.\xa0\nWe’ve seen many examples of pubs and clubs using templates for their AML programs, but without tailoring the templates to their specific business. When we asked some of those pubs and clubs about the details of their programs, they were actually surprised by some of the risks listed, or the controls that were meant to be put in place, under their own program. They had no idea about the finer details, they just ticked the box that they had a program in place.\xa0\nSo the message here is that you can outsource the development of your program, or use a template, but it is your responsibility to ensure it is tailored to your business and reflects your systems and controls. You can outsource the work, but you can’t outsource your legal liability. When we look at these examples, there are lessons to be taken from them.\xa0\nWe are happy to educate people about what we expect to see, but we do expect businesses and their boards to take responsibility for their money laundering programs.\xa0\nIf you have the idea that AUSTRAC will continuously educate and educate and educate and then maybe take action years later - you are mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think your business is too small to take responsibility for compliance – you are also mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think AUSTRAC won’t take further action against you because it has done so before – you are again mistaken.\nYour services and the gambling industry have been subject to this regime for many years now. It is your responsibility to comply with the law.\nEach business needs a tailored approach to compliance based on individual systems and processes and the only way you will meet your compliance obligations is to have a thorough understanding of how criminal activity can infiltrate your specific business.\xa0\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re running a small or large company – we’ve seen significant laundering risks in companies of all sizes. But when it comes to the bigger operators, the harms are greater, because the scale of the harm is magnified.\xa0\nI also want to caution those businesses we have worked with, or that have been subject to regulatory action, against reverting back to risky old ways of operating. We often see businesses letting old practices start to seep back and risk appetites starting to increase after a couple of years. We’d rather see businesses adapt their business model, like the casinos I’ve just mentioned, and remain compliant.\xa0\nOne point that I’d like to highlight, is that many legitimate gambling businesses still need to come to terms with the fact they can’t run a business on ill gotten gains. In some cases this has meant losing a large chunk of revenue that is never coming back.\nTake Crown, Sky City and Star casinos for example – state government controls mean the junkets aren’t returning and the controls put in place to allow them to operate are rigorous, more so than any other gambling business. To be successful and sustainable casinos have needed to reassess their business models.\nThe Crown Resorts group is probably the furthest ahead in this respect. Crown Sydney was designed as a VIP facility but without the junkets, and with the tighter requirements for enhanced customer due diligence they have had to change their business model in response, diversifying their entertainment offerings and focus.\nWe’re pleased to say that Crown has strengthened a number of its systems following AUSTRAC action. They include significantly increasing the resourcing of its AML function, investing in new systems to undertake transaction monitoring and implementing new procedures to better understand the source of their customers’ funds.\xa0\nWe don’t want to just sit on these lessons, we want you to have the best understanding possible. In the past, we have put out information about the lessons learned and we will continue to do so, to close the loop. When we complete some of the bigger enforcement actions that are underway we will share what we learned with our reporting entities so businesses can understand what went wrong and what we expect from them going forward.\nWell that brings us to the question ‘what does the future look like for AUSTRAC?’ I can tell you that the gambling sector is still a focus industry this year.\nOne of the biggest challenges is the gambling sector’s growth and diversification, especially in online gambling. While we have our eyes on the big players, our intelligence division is also watching some of those smaller offshore operators providing illegal scam based platforms.\xa0\nWe’re seeing a rise in so called “scambling”, where unlicensed online gambling platforms advertise on social media and trick people to visit a scam website to participate in gambling. Players are then asked to deposit funds into a PayID but it’s highly unlikely they will ever see their winnings from these sites. This ruse is also being used as a means to launder money from other criminal activities.\nThis is a real example of harm being done to the community, especially to our most vulnerable people, including people in remote and regional Aboriginal communities. The AUSTRAC led Fintel Alliance is working with police, banks and other industry partners to raise awareness of this issue, and try to minimise the harm being done.\xa0\nThe methods used by criminals to launder their dirty money are constantly changing, but AUSTRAC is evolving to meet these challenges.\nThe agency is going through its biggest change in nearly 20 years, as a result of the anti-money laundering reforms that passed the parliament late last year. AUSTRAC currently regulates around 17,000 businesses but that will rise to more than 100,000 as we bring tranche 2 entities, such as real estate agents, accountants and lawyers, under the legislation.\xa0\nThese reforms mean we will have many more touchpoints in the community and we are going to be closing and disrupting many more gaps that organised crime is out to exploit.\nOur staffing, systems and infrastructure is expanding in line with this bigger remit and so too are our intelligence and enforcement capabilities.\nAUSTRAC might be taking a more front foot approach to known risks but we are equally keen to raise standards, work cooperatively with businesses, and educate in the first instance. We are preparing to engage much more with you and we want to see compliance cultures embedded across the industry to prevent exploitation of the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe will work with you to ensure your businesses aren’t leaving the door open to criminal infiltration, which harms the Australian community and, at the end of the day, damages the legitimacy and sustainability of your business and your industry.\xa0\nSo my message is this: don’t turn a blind eye to your legal obligations. Protect the community by protecting your business and we will work together to detect, deter and disrupt illegal activities.

The proceedings allege serious and systemic non-compliance with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.\nAUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said the agency considers there were systemic failures in Entain’s approach to its AML/CTF obligations.\n“AUSTRAC’s proceedings allege that Entain did not develop and maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program and failed to identify and assess the risks it faced. We are alleging this left the company at serious risk of criminal exploitation.\n“Money laundering is often a symptom of serious criminal activity, including fraud, scams and corruption, all of which have equally serious effects on our communities,” he said.\nAUSTRAC’s allegations include that:\n\nEntain’s board and senior management did not have appropriate oversight of its AML/CTF program, which limited its ability to identify the ML/TF risks it faced and its vulnerability to criminal exploitation.\nEntain operated a 24/7 business through its website and app, which created risks that persons unknown to Entain could access and use Entain's betting platform including through third party providers.\nThird parties, including businesses and individuals, accepted cash and other deposits on behalf of Entain to be credited into betting accounts in ways that could obscure the proceeds of crime. Cash is less transparent than other forms of money and is at higher risk of being the proceeds of crime.\nEntain did not have appropriate controls to confirm the identity of customers making these deposits and the source of this money.\nEntain did not conduct appropriate checks on 17 higher risk customers, including examples where Entain did not appropriately deal with the risk that its online betting sites were being exploited by criminals to spend the proceeds of serious crime. This includes allegations that Entain deliberately obscured the identity of some high risk customers, on its own systems, through the use of pseudonyms to “protect their privacy”.\n\n“This is the first time AUSTRAC has brought civil penalty proceedings against businesses operating in the online betting sector, and the Australian arm of Entain is part of one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming groups,” Mr Thomas said.\n“The online betting sector, and all other businesses regulated by AUSTRAC, must take their AML/CTF obligations seriously. This includes ensuring they have appropriate procedures to know who their customer is, even when they rely on third parties to process transactions.”\nThe action taken today is part of AUSTRAC’s ongoing work focussed on gambling businesses in Australia to fight money laundering opportunities in the gambling industry.

This includes raising awareness internally and externally with their stakeholders to help protect customers and the community.\xa0\nUpgrades to system processes and technology: We also observed that investments made in new systems and technology upgrades improved businesses’ ability to detect and report financial crime.\n\nWhile we saw improvements in some areas, below are the key areas we encouraged businesses to focus on:\xa0\n\nBoard oversight and engagement: We encouraged wider board involvement in\xa0managing money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks. Boards should continue to actively engage in developing, assessing and monitoring its ML/TF risk appetite and tolerance. This includes receiving frequent reports, escalating matters to the Board and the Board responding to ML/TF risk exposure.\nCompliance function capacity: Businesses, particularly in emerging and growing sectors, are encouraged to match compliance capabilities and resourcing as they expand, to avoid delays in reporting and gaps in transaction monitoring investigations.\nML/TF risk exposure: Small and medium businesses should regularly review and assess ML/TF risks, which are distinct from enterprise wide risk assessments. Businesses should incorporate insights from publications, such as our\xa02024 money laundering national risk assessment and\xa02024 terrorism financing national risk assessment.\nCustomer identification: Adequate checks on customer identity and source of wealth and funds are crucial for businesses. We understand businesses prioritise a swift and seamless customer experience. However, it’s essential to ensure adequate and periodic reviews of transactions or unusual activity are carried out to assess ML/TF risks and exposures.\xa0\nTransaction monitoring: Tailored rules and triggers to detect high-risk typologies, such as terrorism financing, can help businesses prioritise high-risk investigations that in turn support law enforcement in disrupting illicit activities.\nIndependent reviews: Robust independent reviews of AML/CTF programs deliver better outcomes by identifying gaps and improvements. We encouraged all sectors to consider these aspects when engaging such reviews to avoid any variances in the quality or adequacy.\xa0\n\nWhat you can do\nAUSTRAC will continue engaging with businesses and focus on regulatory activities to\xa0strengthen the financial system against serious crime.\nSome key actions you can take to ensure you do your part include:\n\nensure you are up to date with your\xa0AML/CTF obligations\xa0\nunderstand your\xa0reporting obligations\xa0and report suspicious activity to us\nread new resources and guidance relevant to your industry.\n\n\n', 'date_time': 1733965200, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tHow we ensure data quality for our regulatory and intelligence operations', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/how-we-ensure-data-quality-our-regulatory-and-intelligence-operations', 'content': '\nData quality is the backbone of AUSTRAC’s analytics capabilities.\xa0\nThe accuracy and completeness of data collected from reporting entities is critical to our regulatory and intelligence operations.

Various capacity-building programs between AUSTRAC and FASU over the years have seen FASU emerge and now be able to collaborate and be an active partner and leader amidst its peers in the Pacific. The handover of the Taipan system is a testament of the close relationship that FASU and AUSTRAC have fostered over the years.\nThe Bank of PNG’s FASU Director Wilson Onea said financial crime is borderless.\n“In the blue continent, our strongest link is our weakest link. Ensuring that we continue to build institutional partnerships and capacity is critical to protecting the financial systems that serve our people,” Mr Onea said.\xa0\n“We are fortunate to have such a strong collaboration with AUSTRAC and the Australian Government.”\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\nDeputy High Commissioner, Dr Joanne Loundes, was also present for the launch.\n“Australia’s increased support to PNG through the strong AUSTRAC and FASU relationship is a clear example of how Australia is delivering on our commitments under the Bilateral Security Agreement,” Dr Loundes said.\nAUSTRAC has delivered TAIPAN to ten FIUs across the Pacific region and today’s handover represents the completion of the program. In November, AUSTRAC handed over the system to Vanuatu, Samoa, Palau and Marshall Islands FIUs during the recent Pacific Financial Intelligence Community plenary meeting in Brisbane, Australia.\nAUSTRAC is very proud to support partners in this region to combat existing and emerging money laundering, terrorism financing threats.\xa0\n“I am very pleased to announce that AUSTRAC’s TAIPAN FIU system rollout is now complete and this platform is enhancing the ability of FIUs in the region to respond to these risks”, Mr Thomas said.\nAbout AUSTRAC\nAUSTRAC (the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre) is the Australian Government agency responsible for detecting, deterring and disrupting criminal abuse of the financial system to protect the community from serious and organised crime.\nThrough intelligence led regulation, and enhanced intelligence capabilities, AUSTRAC collects and analyses reports and information to generate financial intelligence.\xa0\nLearn more about AUSTRAC.\nMedia contact\nEmail:\xa0media@austrac.gov.auPhone: 02 9950 0488\n\n', 'date_time': 1733788800, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tAUSTRAC takes action to stamp out financial crime through cryptocurrency ATMs', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/news-and-media/media-release/austrac-takes-action-stamp-out-financial-crime-through-cryptocurrency-atms', 'content': "\nAUSTRAC is cracking down on cryptocurrency ATM providers in Australia who don’t comply with the country’s anti-money laundering regime.\nAUSTRAC intelligence shows cryptocurrency poses a heightened money laundering risk, and is increasingly being exploited for money laundering, scams and money mule activities.\nAn internal AUSTRAC cryptocurrency taskforce\xa0has been established to ensure digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that provide crypto ATM services meet minimum standards and have robust practices in place to identify and minimise the risk that their machines will be used to move money associated with scams, fraud or other proceeds of crime.\nUnder the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) Act 2006, DCEs, including those providing crypto ATM facilities, have to register with AUSTRAC and are also required to:\n\nundertake transaction monitoring\ncomplete know your customer (KYC) information checks on customers\nreport suspicious activity in suspicious matter reports (SMRs)\nsubmit threshold transaction reports (TTRs) for cash deposits and withdrawals of $10,000 or more.\n\nAUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said AUSTRAC will be tightening monitoring of crypto ATM providers, and warns that AUSTRAC will take action against operators who are flouting the rules.\n“Cryptocurrency and crypto ATMs are attractive avenues for criminals looking to launder money, as they are widely accessible and make near-instant and irreversible transfers,” Mr Thomas said.\n“We’re seeing too many Australians falling victim to scams carried out through cryptocurrency, and we’ve heard of some victims losing their life savings, which is just heart breaking.”\n“As the use of cryptocurrency increases, so too will criminal exploitation, which is why this taskforce will work to eliminate non-compliant high risk operations.\n“Cryptocurrency ATM providers need to ensure they are complying with their money laundering obligations and are reducing the risks of crime. If they’re ignoring those obligations they risk being subject to significant financial penalties and AUSTRAC won’t hesitate in taking action.“This is the first step in AUSTRAC’s focus to reduce the criminal use of cryptocurrency in Australia. We will be focusing on this industry over the course of next year.”\nCurrently there are approximately 400 digital currency exchange providers registered with AUSTRAC. While only a small number of these DCEs operate crypto ATM, Australia has 1200 operating crypto ATMs, which is the third highest number globally.\nAUSTRAC develops materials to support DCEs to identify financial crime risks, so they can target, monitor and report suspicious activity to AUSTRAC. Crypto ATM operators who don't comply with their AML/CTF obligations to know their customer, report suspicious activity and identify, manage and mitigate these risks, they could face enforcement action.\nMembers of the public who suspect fraud or scam activity when using a crypto ATM should report this directly to the police and to the National Anti-Scam Centre’s Scamwatch, or the Australian Cyber Security Centre’s ReportCyber. Scamwatch and ReportCyber provides information about how to recognise and avoid scams.

This market in now worth at least $16.5 billion per annum. That’s all illegal money that is being laundered through Australian economy every year, and that’s only one type of domestic crime.\xa0\nCriminals are highly likely drawn to Australia because of our population’s continued proclivity to purchase illicit drugs in large amounts.\xa0 And also the size and stability of our economy and its capacity to absorb foreign proceeds of crime, as well as the unregulated sectors of the Australian economy, like real estate, as a place to store significant illegal wealth.\nFinancial pathways are becoming and will continue to become increasingly complex and interconnected, with visibility of transactions diminishing as funds flow through payment systems that are not always captured by existing regulations.\nThe proceeds of crime generated by organised criminals needs to be placed, layered and integrated into the economy. Because of its size, diverse client base and utilisation of cash, the banking sector remains highly exposed to this risk.\nDue to this risk, and despite the good work and significant investments they’ve done, the banking sector remains a focus for AUSTRAC whilst we also \xa0increase our engagement with other parts of the economy.\nThe growth of digital currency and international digital currency exchanges tailoring themselves to organised crime are major risks and an increasing focus of large scale criminal activity.\nAUSTRAC is also focusing our regulatory efforts on what we have assessed to be high-risk sectors. In the last year, along with banking, we have focused on gambling and remittance sectors.\xa0\nIn 2024 we have had supervisory engagements with more than 100 regulated businesses in the banks and financial services sector.\nWe’ve seen a genuine commitment to embrace engagement with us and a willingness to receive feedback, even when that feedback might be a little challenging.\nBanks increased staff awareness through a variety of methods. This saw improvement in their culture, particularly in their financial crime and AML/CTF responsibilities.\nBut there is still scope to further improve board oversight and understanding. Some businesses we’ve dealt with were not able to demonstrate how or what they reported to their board on AML/CTF matters. They could also not articulate the Board's appetite for money laundering or managing terrorism financing risks.\nWe saw programs being tailored to mitigate changing risks, but more work is needed on this in smaller banks and the non-bank lending sector.\nWe’ve also seen investment in new systems and technology upgrades to enhance financial crime compliance frameworks and to enhance the effectiveness of operations. And this is a positive step, but new systems take time to embed and time to test and we’re keen that businesses don’t lose focus on tackling financial crime now, while waiting for system upgrades.\nWe continue to see mixed quality in relation to outsourcing of AML programs. In some instances, some third party AML/CTF programs are of poor quality and not tailored to the business and its specific risks. Businesses should always remember, it can outsource elements of its AML program but your boards can not outsource its liability to ensure that the program works and that it’s done well.\nWe’ve also had increased focus on non-bank lenders, corporate bookmaking, smaller casinos, Crypto exchanges and digital currency more generally as well as Gold bullion dealers and the results in those areas are a mixed bag. \xa0You can expect to see more activity on those areas in the not too distant future.\nThe financial services sector needs to remain vigilant of evolving risks and trends. We issue guidance and provide education on emerging crime types and it’s vital that your businesses review these and adapt your monitoring systems as needed.\nWe know 2025 may be a significant period of change as businesses prepare for the proposed reform of the AML/CTF regime.\nWe are committed to supporting you through this process. To assist, we are making significant internal changes at AUSTRAC, including a new Education and Industry Engagement Branch, a new Data Division and other investments and changes in the way that we regulate that will be hand in glove with industry to make sure they’re prepared for those changes.\nA fundamental principle of Australia’s Anti Money Laundering regime is the role of industry as the front line of defence against money laundering risks.\nFighting financial crime requires cooperation. Only together can we fight this massive problem. \xa0\n\n", 'date_time': 1731042000, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tFATF updates on global ML/TF risk – October 2024', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/fatf-updates-global-mltf-risk-october-2024', 'content': '\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global group that sets international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) standards, has published two recent updates relating to international ML/TF risk.\nThe reports provide an update on jurisdictions which may pose a risk to the international financial system:\n\nHigh-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action – October 2024:\xa0which notes that the 21 February 2020 call for action in relation to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\xa0Iran and Myanmar remains in effect.\nJurisdictions under Increase Monitoring – October 2024:\xa0which lists jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies in their AML/CTF regimes and are actively working with the FATF to address them.\n\nReporting entities should be aware of countries that pose a higher risk of money laundering or terrorism financing and use this information to help guide ML/TF risk assessments, compliance programs and decisions about submitting suspicious matter reports to AUSTRAC.\nFor further information, see AUSTRAC’s guidance on\xa0high-risk countries, regions and groups.\n\n', 'date_time': 1730844000, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tRegister to attend AUSTRAC’s November forum for AML/CTF advisers ', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/register-attend-austracs-november-forum-amlctf-advisers', 'content': '\nIn November, AUSTRAC is hosting a forum in Melbourne and Sydney exclusively for AML/CTF advisers.

Customers may have difficulty providing documents such as a driver’s licence or birth certificate for a range of reasons including emergencies, personal circumstances, their location or structural barriers. This can severely impact their ability to access essential financial services.\xa0\nUsing alternative identification procedures helps ensure the Australian community can access the financial services that they need. These procedures ensure that people are not unduly excluded from the financial system due to barriers accessing standard identification documents.\xa0\nCustomers that may be impacted include:\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\npeople living in remote communities\npeople experiencing periods of homelessness\nintersex, trans and gender diverse people\npeople affected by family and domestic violence\npeople leaving an emergency or unsafe situation where gathering documents may not be an option.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. There may also be customers who face multiple barriers.\nAbout the updated guidance\nThe guidance is being updated to support financial inclusion outcomes and address industry feedback.\xa0\nIt’s important to note that using alternative identification procedures must always be a risk-based decision for your business, which factors in the individual circumstances and information available.\nFor a summary of the changes visit the consultation page.\nHow to submit your feedback\nRead the draft guidance and learn more about the submission process.

This money is often reinvested in further criminal enterprises that amplify these harms.\nOur role as Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regulator is to ensure that regulated businesses comply with their obligations to have systems and controls in place to manage their risks and protect them and the community from criminal abuse.\nWe recently took enforcement actions against two major companies, Sportsbet Pty Ltd (Sportsbet) and SkyCity Adelaide Pty Ltd (SkyCity), for failing to meet their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act). These actions highlight our commitment to safeguarding Australia's financial system from exploitation.\nOn 30 May 2024, AUSTRAC accepted an enforceable undertaking from online betting company Sportsbet to uplift its compliance with Australia’s AML/CTF laws. This enforceable undertaking represents a legally binding agreement, where Sportsbet has committed to an ongoing remedial action plan to improve its AML/CTF program, which AUSTRAC will monitor to ensure it is undertaken within agreed timeframes.\xa0\nThis enforceable undertaking is designed to help prevent Sportsbet becoming a place criminals can funnel their illicit funds through and reflects AUSTRAC's approach to ensuring that businesses within the online gambling sector meet their AML/CTF obligations. Details of the\xa0enforceable undertaking can be found on the\xa0AUSTRAC website.\nIn another significant development, on 7 June 2024, SkyCity was ordered by the Federal Court of Australia to pay a $67 million penalty after AUSTRAC launched civil penalty proceedings against it for breaches of the AML/CTF Act.\xa0The court found that SkyCity’s AML/CTF Programs failed to meet the requirements of the AML/CTF Act, and that it did not carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence. The casino’s failure to comply allowed high-risk customers to move millions of dollars through the casino, in ways that made the source and ownership of the funds unclear.\nThe $67 million penalty serves as an important reminder to casinos to take their AML/CTF obligations seriously and be vigilant to money laundering and terrorism financing risks. Details of the federal court ruling can be found on the AUSTRAC website.\nWhat you need to do\nThese actions against Sportsbet and SkyCity highlight the importance of AML/CTF compliance across industries and serve as a reminder that businesses must remain vigilant and proactive in their efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.\xa0\nSome key actions you can take to ensure you do your part include:\n\nensure you are up to date with your AML/CTF obligations\xa0\nunderstand your reporting obligations and report suspicious activity to us\nread new resources and guidance relevant to your industry.\n\nTo stay up to date with AUSTRAC’s latest efforts to combat financial crime, visit our\xa0news and media page.\n\n", 'date_time': 1727737200, 'source_id': 'ZdQOFpYBWUzV57vG-irh', 'source_name': 'austrac'}, {'title': '\n\tEnhancements to AUSTRAC Online', 'url': 'https://www.austrac.gov.au/enhancements-austrac-online', 'content': '\nWe are enhancing AUSTRAC Online to make it easier for you and your business to engage with us.

Further analysis of his financial activity showed he had spent more than $50,000 over six years to purchase child sexual exploitation material.\xa0\nThe man was intercepted in May 2023 returning from Bali and searched by the Australian Border Force and Australian Federal Police. He was subsequently arrested for possession and production of child sexual exploitation material on his electronic devices. AUSTRAC provided additional financial intelligence to assist in his prosecution and identification of linked network members.\nIn March 2024, he pleaded guilty to seven charges of child abuse. Two of his victims were rescued from an alleged brothel in the Philippines and work continues to identify other offenders who provided him with access to children online and in person.\nThis investigation also triggered an overseas investigation into sex slavery, which resulted in the arrest of a Philippines-based mother as a facilitator of child sexual exploitation.\n“Child sexual exploitation is a heinous crime against some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” says Jon Brewer, AUSTRAC’s Acting Deputy CEO for Intelligence.\n“Cases like this highlight the role financial intelligence plays when it comes to detecting crimes – and the importance of working with law enforcement agencies and international partners to stop them.”\nHow does AUSTRAC help\nAUSTRAC is a member of the\xa0Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE), led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

This guide provides indicators and behaviours to help financial service providers identify signs of the purchase of child sexual exploitation material.\xa0\nAUSTRAC also helps businesses including financial service providers to detect suspicious transactions by providing updated financial and environmental indicators.\xa0\nHow can I help combat crimes like this\nYou have an important role to play in helping protect the vulnerable members of our community.

He was extradited last month and remanded to custody.\nToday (Friday 11 April), Waugh, from Warrington, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court and admitted a range of firearms offences and a count of conspiring to inflict grievous bodily harm in which he instructed an accomplice to throw acid in a victim’s face.\nWaugh smuggled the guns to the UK where his right-hand man Robert Brazendale, 37, took possession of them and provided them to customers from various organised crime groups.\nIn February 2022, Brazendale, of Selworthy Drive, Warrington, Cheshire, was jailed for 11 years and three months (later reduced to 10 years on appeal) for transferring other firearms from the gun list. Today, he admitted new firearms offences committed with Waugh.\nWaugh, who has a previous conviction for domestic assault of a partner, plotted with gangland enforcer Jonathan Gordon, a member of Liverpool’s Deli Mob, to blind a man with acid.\nWaugh told Gordon, 37, of Kirkdale, Liverpool, and who used the EncroChat handle Valuedbridge, to “double the dose” and “cook” the intended victim with acid.\n“Just need him blind and face melted,” Waugh messaged Gordon.\nOn the day Gordon was due to carry out the attack, police patrol officers approached him in Liverpool and he ran off and the car was seized and attack prevented.\nBrazendale also admitted conspiring to inflict GBH on this victim.\nWaugh and Brazendale will return to court for sentencing on 27 June.\nThe NCA and policing partners recovered two AK47s, Uzi and Skorpion machine guns, a Grand Power automatic pistol, a Smith and Wesson pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\nBen Rutter, NCA senior investigating officer, said: “The NCA worked for five years to trace, locate and bring Philip Waugh to justice under Operation Venetic.\n“He supplied an array of terrifying automatic and semi-automatic weaponry to offenders who were planning horrific crimes. He didn’t care at all about who might be killed in the process, he only cared about money.\n“He is an extremely dangerous offender.\n“The NCA will continue to do everything we can with partners at home and abroad to prevent organised crime groups trafficking firearms.” ', 'date_time': 1744594742, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Operation Machinize: Hundreds of barbershops targeted in NCA-coordinated crackdown', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-machinize-hundreds-of-barbershops-targeted-in-nca-coordinated-crackdown', 'content': '\nBarbershops and other cash-intensive businesses across England have been targeted by police and other law enforcement officers during a three-week crackdown on high street crime.\nIn total, 265 premises were visited across Operation Machinize, where officers secured freezing orders over bank accounts totalling more than £1m, executed 84 warrants and made 35 arrests.\nThe operation saw 55 individuals questioned about their immigration status and a further 97 individuals safeguarded in relation to potential modern slavery.\nIn addition, officers seized more than £40,000 in cash, some 200,000 cigarettes, 7,000 packs of tobacco, over 8,000 illegal vapes and two vehicles. Two cannabis farms were also found, containing a total of 150 plants. Ten shops have been shut, with further closures expected as a result of on-going investigations.\n\nThe NCA estimates that £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or integrated into the legitimate financial system using a variety of laundering techniques.\nCash-intensive businesses such as barbershops, vape shops, nail bars, American-themed sweet shops and car washes are often used by criminals to conceal the origins of illicit cash.\nCrime gangs use them to enter cash into the financial system, mixing legitimate funds with criminal profits to hinder subsequent law enforcement investigations. They are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.\nThe crackdown, which is part of the NCA’s continued disruption of cash being laundered in the UK, involved 19 different police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.\n\nIt was supported by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and coordinated by the NCA’s National Economic Crime Centre, which provided intelligence to assist local forces, as well as funding for operational activity.\nRachael Herbert, Deputy Director of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said:\n“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country.\n“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.\n“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest impact offending in the UK.\n“Here at the National Economic Crime Centre, we coordinate UK-wide action, and lead cross-system efforts to make our financial system more resilient.\n“The excellent results from the first iteration of Operation Machinize are testament to the tireless work of officers across the country, and demonstrate our resolve to clamp down on organised criminality abusing the high street.”\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said:\n“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.\n“This successful NCA-led operation highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face and demonstrates our collective determination to make our streets safer, a key pillar of this government’s Plan for Change.\n“We will continue to support the NCA, and other law enforcement partners, as we make the UK an even more hostile environment for organised crime.”\n10 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1744286400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Preston man charged with assisting people smuggling kingpin', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/preston-man-charged-with-assisting-people-smuggling-kingpin', 'content': '\nA man from Preston has been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation into people smuggling.\nIranian national Anjan Ahmadi, age 26, of Stafano Road, Preston, was originally arrested in July 2024 as part of an enquiry into the activities of Amanj Hasan Zada.\nZada, also of Stefano Road, was convicted of a series of people smuggling offences in November 2024, when he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\nThe NCA were able to link him to a series of movements of migrants into the UK from France in late 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe he is part of the global people smuggling network moving migrants from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) into the UK and Europe.

But Verschueren invented the recipient to avoid checks during the first Covid lockdown and the hospital was in no way connected with the dry ice.\nUnder the dry ice were blocks of cocaine.

These are the first convictions for enabling a designated person.\nIn 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Dmitrii Ovsiannikov as governor of the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a position he held until July 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU, and when the UK left the EU, the UK imposed financial sanctions under the Russia Regulations 2019.\nAlthough sanctioned, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov secured a UK passport in January 2023 by virtue of having a British father.\xa0 Dmitrii arrived in Britain on 1 February 2023, and joined his wife and two young children\xa0who were already living in his brother's house in Clapham.\nThe same month, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov applied for a bank account into which his wife transferred £76,000, allowing him to put down a deposit on a Mercedes Benz GLC 300 SUV. However, the bank subsequently realised he was on the UK sanctions list and froze the account.\nDmitrii recovered his deposit, after which his brother Alexei Owsjanikow bought the car instead, and insured it for Dmitrii to drive.\nAt the time, Dmitrii was well aware he was subject to UK sanctions, having already applied to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office to have his designation lifted.\nDmitrii Ovsiannikov was arrested and interviewed in January 2024. Alexei Owsjanikow attended a voluntarily interview about his role in enabling sanctions evasion. Four months later, Alexei paid more than £40,000 in school fees for his brother's two youngest children, a breach of the sanctions.\nGraeme Biggar, Director General of the NCA said: “Dmitrii Ovsiannikov and his brother clearly knew that he was subject to these sanctions and deliberately took steps to circumvent the controls.\n“These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.\n“Today’s verdict is testament to the hard work and determination of the NCA’s Combatting Kleptocracy Cell, which has delivered more than 180 disruptions to remove or reduce a criminal threat posed by Putin-linked elites and their enablers since the invasion of Ukraine.”\nStephen Doughty, FCDO Sanctions Minister said:\xa0“Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions. Today’s verdict proves otherwise.\n“We are resolutely committed to increasing pressure on Putin, his cronies, and all those who aid his barbaric war in Ukraine.\n“When this government came to office, we made clear we were committed to making sure sanctions were used most effectively – and crucially, robustly enforced.\n“We have been working tirelessly with colleagues across government to ensure our sanctions enforcement regime is both effective and efficient, and to give the right tools to our law enforcement agencies to be able to take robust action when necessary.”\nJulius Capon, Unit Head Prosecutor of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The sanctions regime was introduced against key individuals to encourage Russia to cease military action because it was hoped those with power will be hampered in their normal international business dealings.\n“Dmitrii Ovsyannikov was a high-profile official who was appointed by President Vladimir Putin as the Governor of Sevastopol after Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia. He knew he had been on the UK sanctions list since 2017 but chose to ignore this.\n“Another member of his family sought deliberately to breach the sanctions and showed complete disregard for the law.\n“We hope this sends a clear message that the CPS and NCA investigators will work closely together to seek the convictions of sanction busters.\n“We will start proceeds of crime proceedings to get back illegally obtained cash and assets.”\n09 April 2025 ", 'date_time': 1744200000, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Operation Venetic: Drug dealer caught with five kilos of cocaine found to have imported a further £17m worth', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-venetic-drug-dealer-caught-with-five-kilos-of-cocaine-found-to-have-imported-a-further-17m-worth', 'content': '\nA south London drug dealer convicted for supplying cocaine has been jailed after his seized encrypted phone showed he had imported more than half a tonne of the class A drug.\nKurtis Hoyte, 35, from Beckenham, was investigated\xa0by the\xa0Organised\xa0Crime Partnership (OCP) – a joint National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service unit.\nOCP officers arrested him in May 2020 after he was observed handing over five kilos of cocaine with an estimated street value of £180,000 to the driver of a flat-bed truck near\xa0Beckenham\xa0Hill Station.\nThey seized three phones from him, one of which was an encrypted EncroChat device.

Our reach is global and they cannot act with impunity.”\nBaroness Chapman of Darlington, FCDO Minister responsible for Irregular Migration said: \n“Working with other countries is vital to tackle this vile trade – stopping people being trafficked across the world at huge risk to their lives and securing our borders at home.\n“My message to the people smugglers is clear: wherever you are in the world, we are working with international partners to bring you to justice through joint operations like this.”\nThe arrests in Libya come after the conviction of a UK-based people smuggler who was organising crossings from the North African country to Italy.\nNCA investigators, working with Italian partners, were able to evidence Egyptian national Ahmed Ramadan Mohamad Ebid’s involvement in at least seven separate crossings which brought around 3,800 people across in 2022 and 2023.\nThe 42-year-old, who was living in Isleworth, London, during the time of his offending, had previously pleaded guilty to people smuggling offences, but claimed he had only played a small part in the crossings.\nFollowing a Newton Hearing a judge rejected his claims on Friday 28 March, accepting evidence gained by the NCA demonstrating his organisational role.\nHe will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on 19 May 2025.\n3 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743681600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Dark web site taken offline as information on 63 users passed to UK forces', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/dark-web-site-taken-offline-as-information-on-63-users-passed-to-uk-forces', 'content': '\nSixty-three UK-based users of a Dark Web site hosting child sexual abuse material have been identified following work by the National Crime Agency.\nPolice in Germany started an investigation into the site, Kidflix, which resembled a well-known video streaming service.\nThey identified 1275 users from around the world who had either paid for access to material through crypto currency, or earned access through uploading their own material where they would earn site specific credits which would allow them access to further child abuse imagery.\nAfter receiving information from the German authorities in February, NCA officers identified 63 UK users who were active on the site and had used cryptocurrency to access CSA material.

Starkcake had the links to drugs suppliers overseas and those selling potentially fatal substances on UK streets. His messages revealed he was also a professional money launderer, managing and hiding millions of pounds he and others made from crime.”\nInvestigators found clues to Starkcake’s real-life identity in his messages, pairing these with cell site and financial data to verify it was Vaid.\nOne message to Starkcake indicated that criminal cash had been paid into the account of “H Vaid”, which investigators identified corresponded with a transaction on Vaid’s bank account. Officers also identified that Vaid made a payment at a café in Dubai around the time Starkcake told an associate he was in the country.\nInvestigators gathered cell site data that showed Vaid’s movements correlated with conversations about Starkcake’s whereabouts. In one case, data indicated Vaid was at a river near his then-home after Starkcake told an associate he was going for a riverside walk.\nInvestigators subsequently arrested Vaid at his home address in April 2024.\nThe evidence gathered by investigators was so compelling that Vaid pleaded guilty to 12 drugs and proceeds of crime charges, and a count of conspiracy to blackmail, relating to threats he made to a debtor.\nLead officer Seldon concluded: \n“Vaid attempted to fly under the radar by using an encrypted phone and getting others to do his bidding, but he underestimated the capability and tenacity of investigators.\n“By taking a pivotal person like Vaid out of the service of organised crime groups, the NCA is disrupting the supply of the most dangerous drugs in the UK and taking the profit out of ruining lives.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Man charged in NCA investigation over cocaine stash in electric wheelchair', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-charged-in-nca-investigation-over-cocaine-stash-in-electric-wheelchair', 'content': '\nA man has been charged with drug smuggling following a National Crime Agency investigation after nearly £1m of cocaine was found hidden in an electric wheelchair.\nCasimiro De Lemos Francisco, 56, was stopped at Manchester Airport on Sunday after he arrived on a flight from Bridgetown in Barbados.\nBorder Force officers scanned the wheelchair which contained 11 packages, weighing 12k, concealed in the seat and backrest.\nDe Lemos Francisco, a Portuguese national, was remanded today at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court and will appear next at Manchester Crown Court on 6 May.\n\nNCA senior investigating officer Charles Lee, said:\n“The concealment shows the ingenuity crime groups employ to smuggle cocaine.\n“The NCA works with partners at home and abroad to combat the threat of Class A drugs and protect the UK public.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Brothers jailed for 31 years for raping girls', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-brothers-jailed-for-31-years-for-raping-girls', 'content': '\nTwo brothers who raped vulnerable girls 18 years ago have been jailed for 31 years, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nMark Evans, 37, and Robert Evans, 40, abused children in Rotherham over a two-year period starting in 2006.\nToday [28 March] at Sheffield Crown Court they were sentenced to 14 and 17 years’ imprisonment respectively for their crimes.\nThe men, aged 18 and 21 around the time, intimidated girls and plied them with drugs and alcohol before luring them to locations where they attacked them.\nThe brothers were arrested in August 2020 after officers from the NCA’s Operation Stovewood, examining historic sexual abuse in Rotherham, investigated allegations made by three victims.Specially-trained NCA officers spoke with the women after identifying they were potentially victims.\nTwo of the women subsequently told specialist investigators they were raped by both brothers.\nOne of them was 13 at the time. She was given alcohol by Mark Evans before she and some friends accompanied him to a disused barn. He then separated her from her friends and raped her.The same woman was attacked by Robert Evans several months later, when he lured the girl to a house in Rotherham by lying that one of her friends would be there.\n\nPictured:\xa0Mark Evans (L) and Robert Evans (R)\nRobert Evans plied her with alcohol as they took a bus to the house. Once Evans had the victim alone at the house, he raped her. She recalled he seemed amused by this.\nAnother woman related how she too was raped by both brothers when she was 14. She knew the men because they spent time with other girls her age.She recounted how Mark Evans walked her home one evening because it was dark, but as they passed through an alleyway he raped her.\nShe and the first victim were later lured by Robert Evans to a house, on a separate occasion to when the first victim was attacked by him. At the house, Robert Evans forced the second girl into a bathroom and raped her.\nThe third victim was age 13 when Mark Evans began grooming her by giving her alcohol and drugs, and calling her his “girlfriend”. The victim told officers how Mark Evans visited her at her home and asked her for sex. Fearing Evans would dump her, the girl complied with his request, and he took her into an alleyway where he had sex with her.\nThese were just some of the sexual offences committed against the girls which the men denied when NCA investigators arrested them.\nHowever, following a two-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court the brothers were found guilty of a number of sexual offences, including rape, on 4 December 2024.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, NCA Senior Investigator Kim Boreham said: “I would like to recognise the courage and strength of the three victims in this case. For almost twenty years these women have suffered the profound consequences of Mark and Robert Evans’ crimes, while the two men continued their lives as normal.\n“These brave women have been determined to receive justice and the National Crime Agency has matched their resolve, ensuring the Evans brothers have been held to account.“I hope the victims will find some peace in knowing their attackers are no longer living free today.\n“I encourage anyone who was sexually abused as a child, no matter how long ago, to report it to police. Every victim deserves justice.”\nSamantha Thompson, Specialist Prosecutor, of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The Evans brothers targeted and groomed young girls including with alcohol and drugs,\xa0for child sexual abuse and rape.\n“The lifelong physical and emotional trauma caused to victims by men like the Evans brothers cannot be understated. This type of conduct has equally damaged the community confidence of Rotherham. \xa0\n“We would like to thank the victims\xa0in this case for coming forward and reporting this devastating crime. I hope this conviction sends a clear message that the CPS will continue to relentlessly pursue justice and prosecute those who sexually exploit children, whenever that abuse took place.\n“I encourage any victims of child sexual abuse and sexual violence to report the crimes committed against them to the police. You are not alone and there is always help available.”\nAdults can report sexual abuse suffered as a child by calling police on 101, or reporting it in person at a police station.

NCA analysts estimate that thousands of users – offenders and victims – based in the UK and other western countries have exchanged millions of messages online relating to sexual and physical abuse.\nAlthough adults are involved in these online communities, of particular concern is that offenders are predominantly teenage boys that often share sadistic and misogynistic material, and have been seen to target those their own age or younger.\nOffenders include a new generation of young, English-speaking cyber criminals who work together to execute data breaches and commit fraud, launch malware or ransomware attacks, and use social engineering and grooming techniques on victims.\nThe NCA and UK law enforcement have identified a number of cases in which girls, some as young as 11, have been coerced into seriously harming or sexually abusing themselves, siblings or pets.\nIn some instances, victims have been groomed into offending themselves.\nNCA Director General Graeme Biggar said:\n“This is a hugely complex and deeply concerning phenomenon. Young people are being drawn into these sadistic and violent online gangs where they are collaborating at scale to inflict, or incite others to commit, serious harm.\n“These groups are not lurking on the dark web, they exist in the same online world and platforms young people use on a daily basis. It is especially concerning to see the impact this is having on young girls who are often groomed into hurting themselves and in some cases, even encouraged to attempt suicide.\n“The NCA is coordinating UK law enforcement’s response to this emerging threat. We are collaborating with policing, tech companies, safeguarding agencies and psychologists to better understand how young people become offenders and safeguard victims.\n“Operating online clearly makes these offenders feel protected and out of reach but that is absolutely not the case. There have already been convictions, we and partners have made arrests in the UK and overseas, and further investigations are ongoing.\n“I’d encourage parents and carers to have regular conversations with their child about what they do online, and ensure they know they have your support should they need it.”\nThe online landscape of these networks is vast, with many groups having a different focus such as cybercrime or inflicting physical harm. However, membership is loose and fluid which leads to the range of different criminality being committed by individual offenders.\nLast month following an NCA investigation, Richard Ehiemere was convicted of fraud and indecent images of children (IIOC) offences, committed when he was just 17 and linked to a prolific online harms group.\nIn January, 19-year-old Cameron Finnigan was jailed for assisting suicide, possession of IIOC, a terror offence, and criminal damage, following an investigation by Counter Terror Policing South East (CTPSE).\nEvidence suggests that offenders are motivated by gaining notoriety and status, which can be achieved based on the harm they inflict and the depravity of the content they share. These networks share content relating to a broad and diverse range of extreme belief systems that they use to justify violence.\nSexual gratification can also be a motivating factor and in some cases, offenders are finding opportunities to profit from their criminality directly, or by selling material to others. The NCA is engaging with experts and academics to improve our understanding of motivations of offenders in this area and what can be done to deter them.\nAlso common across networks is the use of coercion and extortion tactics. Offenders manipulate victims by grooming them, or convincing them that they are in a relationship. As with other types of grooming, this leads to victims not recognising themselves as such, or being too scared to come forward, which likely contributes to the underreporting of this offending.\nJess Phillips, Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, said:\n“The scale of child sexual abuse in this report is absolutely horrific and drives home the need for a co-ordinated response to tackle this global issue.\n“We have seen the heartbreaking impact of crimes such as grooming and sextortion on victims around the world—many of them children who have been blackmailed and manipulated into sharing images of themselves, which has devastatingly led to some children taking their own lives.\n“This is why this government is using every lever at our disposal to make the UK a safer place for children online, including implementation of the Online Safety Act which has some of the strongest laws in the world to protect children.\n“My message to parents is to have open conversations with your children and to seek support if you are concerned about child sexual abuse.\n“My message to tech companies is simple: this is your responsibility too. You must ensure your platforms are safe for children, so that we can protect the most vulnerable and put predators behind bars.”\nAssistant Chief Constable Alastair Simpson, national policing lead for Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse & Undercover Online, said:\n“The growth of Com networks that incite and encourage children and vulnerable adults towards acts of self-harm, suicide and violence are hugely concerning.\n“The role of undercover online officers is vital in this space, and my message to anyone who is exploiting children online: remember that there is no space where criminals operate that we cannot go, and investigations into these networks have already begun.\n“Policing will always play its part, but social media providers have a clear role to play in monitoring and regulating their platforms to root out this abhorrent criminal behaviour and make all online spaces safe for children and adults.\n“I would encourage anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to report it to police, you will be met with empathy and respect, and there are organisations that can support you.”\nChildren and young people are better protected when they have adults around them who they feel they can trust, talk to and won’t be blamed by.

This could be a real photo taken by the victim, or a fake image created of them by the offender.\nNCA-commissioned research conducted prior to the campaign\'s launch showed that 74% of boys questioned did not fully understand what sextortion was, the same proportion\xa0didn\'t see requests for nude images as a warning sign or attempt of \'sextortion\',\xa073% were not aware of how to report incidents and only 12% admitted they may be at risk of \'sextortion\'.\n\'Sextortion\' can be perpetrated by organised crime groups based overseas, predominantly in some West African countries, but also South East Asia.\nThey are motivated by making money quickly, rather than by sexual gratification, and in some cases have gone from initial contact to blackmailing their victim in under an hour.\nAll age groups and genders have been targeted, but the month-long\xa0campaign is aimed at boys aged between 15 and 17.\nThe NCA\'s\xa0CEOP Safety Centre received 380 reports of \'sextortion\' in 2024 and in the first five months of 2024, police forces received an average of 117 reports of \'sextortion\' from under 18\'s each month. However, offences related to Child Sexual Abuse are generally underreported and the actual figure is likely to be higher.\nIn the year to June 2024, the US National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) received an average of 556 reports of \'sextortion\' per week, amounting to over 28,000 global cases per year – up from 26,718 the previous year.\nThe campaign follows an unprecedented alert issued by the NCA in April last year to teachers across the UK, which reached an estimated 320,000 - 365,000 people or roughly two thirds of all teaching staff.\nThese professionals reported that the alert had helped them recognise \'sextortion\', and made them better prepared if they should encounter any cases of it.\nAlongside this new campaign for teenage boys, the NCA is also issuing guidance for parents and carers on how to support their child if they become a victim.

It accounts for approximately 41% of all crime reports, and costs an estimated £6.8bn each year in England and Wales alone.\nEvery single UK police force and Regional Organised Crime Unit took part in the operation. They were joined by national agencies including the Financial Conduct Authority, National Crime Agency and National Trading Standards.\n\nIn Merseyside, more than £2.7 million in suspected criminal cash and assets was seized or forfeited, including £900,000-worth of high-value watches. The force also issued five account freezing orders totalling over £128,000. 12 suspects were interviewed as part of ongoing investigations into various fraud-related offences, and three others were charged.\nLeicestershire Police executed 18 warrants. 18 suspects were arrested and another two were interviewed voluntarily.

Three individuals have already been charged.\n\nSeveral National Crime Agency investigations, into high harm transnational frauds, all of which involve its Complex Financial Crime Teams, are ongoing.\nThe results represent a 91% increase on last year’s cash seizure figures, and 28% increase on last year’s cease and desist figures under Operation Henhouse. They show that through coordinated action, forces nationwide can tackle what is a complex and quickly evolving threat.\nNick Sharp, Deputy Director Fraud at the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) in the NCA, said:\n“This year’s Operation Henhouse results are a testament to the determination of officers and officials across the country to work together to tackle what can be a devastating and lifechanging crime.\n“The National Economic Crime Centre continues to work closely with law enforcement partners, the private sector and international counterparts to disrupt the highest harm organised crime groups who use technology to launch frauds on an industrial scale, often from overseas.”\nDetective Superintendent Oliver Little, from the Lead Force Operations Room at the City of London Police, said:\n“Henhouse is one of our most significant policing operations that we coordinate each year. As the National Lead Force for fraud, we have a responsibility to deliver impactful results across the UK, and we can't thank all the participating forces enough for their hard work and dedication throughout Henhouse 4.\n“Fraud can take many vindictive and harmful forms, but through the combined efforts of forces up and down the country, including those at the City of London Police, we can make a real difference in stopping criminals in their tracks. With over £7.5m seized and 433 arrests made during Henhouse 4, we will look to build on this success throughout the rest of 2025.”\nMinister for Fraud Lord Hanson said:\n“Fraud is a truly terrible crime which takes many forms and can affect anyone. We are determined to meet the scale of the issue head-on.\n“The ongoing success of Operation Henhouse demonstrates the excellence of police and law enforcement partners, and the real-world impact of their activity to crack down on this truly pernicious crime. We will continue to work closely with them to highlight the importance of the Stop! Think Fraud campaign, and to introduce a new expanded Fraud Strategy, as part of our Plan for Change.”\nThe public can take steps to help protect themselves. It is essential that they continue to report fraud to Action Fraud, and follow advice found on the Stop! Think Fraud website. Every report helps the NCA and policing identify and support victims, prevent future fraud, repatriate losses, and target the criminals, wherever they are.\n19 March 2025 ", 'date_time': 1742385600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}]

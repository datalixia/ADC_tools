Or worse, imagine running a business that relies on dirty money and turning a blind eye to crimals infiltrating that business, for the benefit of profit. It might sound hard to believe but these are some of the failings AUSTRAC has observed in the gambling sector. This is no way to run a legitimate and sustainable business.\nSerious and organised crime costs Australia more than 68 billion dollars a year - that’s according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. We all have role to play in stamping out illegal activity and preventing the harm it’s causing the community. And it is causing harm. Money-laundering funds are generated by the very worst criminal behaviour and those funds are reinvested back into that behaviour, creating a thriving criminal underworld.\nThe value of the domestic illicit drug market alone is worth at least $12.4 billion dollars per year.\xa0Not only that, we estimate tax fraud to range from between $1.8 and $6.3b a year, more than $2b in scam proceeds. – All this money then needs to be laundered through the Australian economy, every single year. Australia is also a very attractive place for international money laundering syndicates to launder proceeds of foreign crime also.\xa0\nThe people who do that are persistent, innovative and professional. Not only do we deal with international crime networks but we are dealing with international money laundering organisations. That is, criminal organisations that just specialise in money laundering. They bid against each other for work\xa0and they consistently look for holes in our regulatory controls so they can launder money through them.\xa0\nThat’s why we are tireless in ensuring businesses are alert to their risks and have effective and working controls in place. AUSTRAC has a dual remit: we are Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator as well as Australia’s financial intelligence unit. We play an integral role in safeguarding the Australian community and the economy. But so do you.\xa0\nYour suspicious matter reporting and know your customer processes help us detect, deter and disrupt serious and organised crime, so that we can build resilience against criminal exploitation in legitimate businesses and financial markets.\xa0\nThe challenges to the gambling industry include the digitisation of currency, financial systems that are more dispersed and complex, the need for more sophisticated customer verification processes, and competition from other players in a rapidly evolving online sector.\nAll these things put your businesses under pressure. But if you don’t take your obligations seriously, if you don’t look out for the gaps where the dirty money can get in, the criminals will exploit you. And that’s what I want to talk to you about today.\nI’ve been the CEO of AUSTRAC for just over a year and I’m so proud of the work we’ve done in that time to reduce harm in the community. While we’ve been working with industry and our reporting entities to reduce that harm, AUSTRAC is not in the business of continuous education without action.\xa0\nIt’s important that businesses understand their legal obligations because I'm prepared to take strong and swift action where it's warranted.\nThere's no question about where the funds come from and how those funds are impacting Australians. There’s the crime that led to the profits in the first place – and the reinvestment of those profits into more crime. At the worst end of the scale we’re talking about drugs, scams, child exploitation and significant amounts of human trafficking. So if you are operating a gambling business you’ve got a pretty big responsibility.\nAUSTRAC uses a range of regulatory tools and powers to promote compliance and we tailor our approach based on the level of risk posed by the entities we regulate and their circumstances in their industry.\xa0\nIn some cases we can focus on education, or collaboration with a business. Or if a business publicly recognises its deficiencies and shows a commitment to addressing the issues, AUSTRAC may accept an enforceable undertaking as we have in the gambling industry.\xa0\nSometimes a campaign targeting a specific sector, is needed. A couple of years ago, AUSTRAC launched a corporate bookmaker campaign focusing on some of the largest online bookmakers in Australia. We found that many of the bookmakers had only a basic understanding of their money laundering risks, and because of that, they didn’t have appropriate controls in place to identify or manage those risks.\xa0\nAs a result of the lack of controls, we found a number of customers had gambled with illegally obtained money. For example we found financial advisers using other people’s money to fund their gambling habits. But thanks to that campaign, there are now better systems and controls in place at a number of bookmakers and this dodgy activity, which clearly harms the community, is far more likely to be detected and reported to AUSTRAC.\xa0\nWith cases where we find serious non-compliance, we will apply for a civil penalty and as you can see in recent years, court action has led to some significant fines. So AUSTRAC is more than happy to work in cooperation with businesses that are doing the right thing, but because of the harm that money laundering and organised crime causes the community, it can require us to take that kind of swift action.\nI’ll state the obvious here: there’s a significant risk of money laundering in the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe launched our Money Laundering National Risk Assessment last year. If you read it you would have seen our assessment of the gambling sector. Casinos pose a high money laundering risk and betting agencies, corporate bookmakers, and pubs and clubs are assessed as posing a medium risk for money laundering.\nDespite sustained regulatory and law enforcement efforts, casinos continue to be exploited for large-scale money laundering – and that’s because they are exposed to a wide range of vulnerabilities and aspects of their operating models make them very attractive to criminals.\nCasino risks come as no surprise to anyone here. But some of the issues we’re seeing across the sector in other businesses include:\n\nAnonymous individuals and high-value customers who are continuing to launder money through gambling services.\nIndividuals and organised criminals that are both domestic and international.\xa0\nA significant number of cash transactions, as large sums of money can be moved in a short period of time through some gaming activities.\xa0\nOnline gaming services that are highly accessible and limit face to face interaction which means less opportunity to generate behavioural suspicion.\xa0\n\nAUSTRAC has recently taken strong action against gambling companies where the risk has been large and the responsibility has been negligent. We’ve had successful court proceedings against Crown’s casinos and Sky City. Legal action is currently underway against Star and Entain.\xa0\nRemediation is a big job and will continue to be a big job for these businesses, which are now operating under much more stringent regulatory supervision as well as a public spotlight. But we can all learn from what went wrong.\xa0\nI want to share some of the findings from our recent enforcement action.\nIn several cases, we've seen clear examples of boards and executives turning a blind eye to crime for the benefit of profit. A key failure that we have observed is when boards take a “tick and flick” approach to their AML responsibilities. In these situations we have seen cultural failures where the important questions are just not asked, or the questions that are asked are not sufficiently robust.\xa0Ignorance may appear an easy way out for boards, but its certainly no excuse.\xa0\nYou just have to look at our civil proceedings against Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth - these concluded almost two years ago - to see examples of board failures.\xa0\nCrown continued a business relationship with a major casino junket operator until 2021, even though it was aware of allegations the operator was connected to organised crime. When ordering Crown to pay a $450 million dollar penalty, Justice Michael Lee said that it was clear that senior management within Crown knew of the high risk posed by junkets.\nOver a period of a year and half there were 75 suspicious 'incidents' involving a total of around $23 million in cash, in a private gaming room which Crown Melbourne gave one casino junket operator exclusive access to.\nThere were also billions of dollars in transactions that Crown failed to appropriately monitor. We have since seen substantial and ongoing efforts undertaken by Crown to address\xa0these failings.\xa0\nPleasingly, Crown along with every other casino in Australia, is now part of AUSTRACs public private partnership, the Fintel Alliance Casino Working group, which works across the sector to surface criminality.\nThrough some of our other regulatory actions, we've seen instances where international organisations operating in Australia are not paying attention to Australian laws. I was in Paris a few weeks ago for a Financial Action Taskforce meeting and online gambling was one of the sectors that was raised. I’ve seen examples of international companies failing to understand the risks that exist in specific jurisdictions, and therefore failing to understand and comply with the laws of that country.\nWe identified one gambling business that had a related overseas company contracted to exercise many of its AML functions for all of its customers, regardless of whether they were in Australia, the UK, somewhere in Europe… you get the idea. A one-size fits all approach is not effective.\xa0\nAnother issue we've seen is companies outsourcing their money laundering responsibilities without follow up, which means these companies aren’t attuned to the risks that their products create, so they’re not mitigating those basic risks properly.\xa0\nWe’ve seen many examples of pubs and clubs using templates for their AML programs, but without tailoring the templates to their specific business. When we asked some of those pubs and clubs about the details of their programs, they were actually surprised by some of the risks listed, or the controls that were meant to be put in place, under their own program. They had no idea about the finer details, they just ticked the box that they had a program in place.\xa0\nSo the message here is that you can outsource the development of your program, or use a template, but it is your responsibility to ensure it is tailored to your business and reflects your systems and controls. You can outsource the work, but you can’t outsource your legal liability. When we look at these examples, there are lessons to be taken from them.\xa0\nWe are happy to educate people about what we expect to see, but we do expect businesses and their boards to take responsibility for their money laundering programs.\xa0\nIf you have the idea that AUSTRAC will continuously educate and educate and educate and then maybe take action years later - you are mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think your business is too small to take responsibility for compliance – you are also mistaken.\xa0\nIf you think AUSTRAC won’t take further action against you because it has done so before – you are again mistaken.\nYour services and the gambling industry have been subject to this regime for many years now. It is your responsibility to comply with the law.\nEach business needs a tailored approach to compliance based on individual systems and processes and the only way you will meet your compliance obligations is to have a thorough understanding of how criminal activity can infiltrate your specific business.\xa0\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re running a small or large company – we’ve seen significant laundering risks in companies of all sizes. But when it comes to the bigger operators, the harms are greater, because the scale of the harm is magnified.\xa0\nI also want to caution those businesses we have worked with, or that have been subject to regulatory action, against reverting back to risky old ways of operating. We often see businesses letting old practices start to seep back and risk appetites starting to increase after a couple of years. We’d rather see businesses adapt their business model, like the casinos I’ve just mentioned, and remain compliant.\xa0\nOne point that I’d like to highlight, is that many legitimate gambling businesses still need to come to terms with the fact they can’t run a business on ill gotten gains. In some cases this has meant losing a large chunk of revenue that is never coming back.\nTake Crown, Sky City and Star casinos for example – state government controls mean the junkets aren’t returning and the controls put in place to allow them to operate are rigorous, more so than any other gambling business. To be successful and sustainable casinos have needed to reassess their business models.\nThe Crown Resorts group is probably the furthest ahead in this respect. Crown Sydney was designed as a VIP facility but without the junkets, and with the tighter requirements for enhanced customer due diligence they have had to change their business model in response, diversifying their entertainment offerings and focus.\nWe’re pleased to say that Crown has strengthened a number of its systems following AUSTRAC action. They include significantly increasing the resourcing of its AML function, investing in new systems to undertake transaction monitoring and implementing new procedures to better understand the source of their customers’ funds.\xa0\nWe don’t want to just sit on these lessons, we want you to have the best understanding possible. In the past, we have put out information about the lessons learned and we will continue to do so, to close the loop. When we complete some of the bigger enforcement actions that are underway we will share what we learned with our reporting entities so businesses can understand what went wrong and what we expect from them going forward.\nWell that brings us to the question ‘what does the future look like for AUSTRAC?’ I can tell you that the gambling sector is still a focus industry this year.\nOne of the biggest challenges is the gambling sector’s growth and diversification, especially in online gambling. While we have our eyes on the big players, our intelligence division is also watching some of those smaller offshore operators providing illegal scam based platforms.\xa0\nWe’re seeing a rise in so called “scambling”, where unlicensed online gambling platforms advertise on social media and trick people to visit a scam website to participate in gambling. Players are then asked to deposit funds into a PayID but it’s highly unlikely they will ever see their winnings from these sites. This ruse is also being used as a means to launder money from other criminal activities.\nThis is a real example of harm being done to the community, especially to our most vulnerable people, including people in remote and regional Aboriginal communities. The AUSTRAC led Fintel Alliance is working with police, banks and other industry partners to raise awareness of this issue, and try to minimise the harm being done.\xa0\nThe methods used by criminals to launder their dirty money are constantly changing, but AUSTRAC is evolving to meet these challenges.\nThe agency is going through its biggest change in nearly 20 years, as a result of the anti-money laundering reforms that passed the parliament late last year. AUSTRAC currently regulates around 17,000 businesses but that will rise to more than 100,000 as we bring tranche 2 entities, such as real estate agents, accountants and lawyers, under the legislation.\xa0\nThese reforms mean we will have many more touchpoints in the community and we are going to be closing and disrupting many more gaps that organised crime is out to exploit.\nOur staffing, systems and infrastructure is expanding in line with this bigger remit and so too are our intelligence and enforcement capabilities.\nAUSTRAC might be taking a more front foot approach to known risks but we are equally keen to raise standards, work cooperatively with businesses, and educate in the first instance. We are preparing to engage much more with you and we want to see compliance cultures embedded across the industry to prevent exploitation of the gambling sector.\xa0\nWe will work with you to ensure your businesses aren’t leaving the door open to criminal infiltration, which harms the Australian community and, at the end of the day, damages the legitimacy and sustainability of your business and your industry.\xa0\nSo my message is this: don’t turn a blind eye to your legal obligations. Protect the community by protecting your business and we will work together to detect, deter and disrupt illegal activities.

The proceedings allege serious and systemic non-compliance with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.\nAUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said the agency considers there were systemic failures in Entain’s approach to its AML/CTF obligations.\n“AUSTRAC’s proceedings allege that Entain did not develop and maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program and failed to identify and assess the risks it faced. We are alleging this left the company at serious risk of criminal exploitation.\n“Money laundering is often a symptom of serious criminal activity, including fraud, scams and corruption, all of which have equally serious effects on our communities,” he said.\nAUSTRAC’s allegations include that:\n\nEntain’s board and senior management did not have appropriate oversight of its AML/CTF program, which limited its ability to identify the ML/TF risks it faced and its vulnerability to criminal exploitation.\nEntain operated a 24/7 business through its website and app, which created risks that persons unknown to Entain could access and use Entain's betting platform including through third party providers.\nThird parties, including businesses and individuals, accepted cash and other deposits on behalf of Entain to be credited into betting accounts in ways that could obscure the proceeds of crime. Cash is less transparent than other forms of money and is at higher risk of being the proceeds of crime.\nEntain did not have appropriate controls to confirm the identity of customers making these deposits and the source of this money.\nEntain did not conduct appropriate checks on 17 higher risk customers, including examples where Entain did not appropriately deal with the risk that its online betting sites were being exploited by criminals to spend the proceeds of serious crime. This includes allegations that Entain deliberately obscured the identity of some high risk customers, on its own systems, through the use of pseudonyms to “protect their privacy”.\n\n“This is the first time AUSTRAC has brought civil penalty proceedings against businesses operating in the online betting sector, and the Australian arm of Entain is part of one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming groups,” Mr Thomas said.\n“The online betting sector, and all other businesses regulated by AUSTRAC, must take their AML/CTF obligations seriously. This includes ensuring they have appropriate procedures to know who their customer is, even when they rely on third parties to process transactions.”\nThe action taken today is part of AUSTRAC’s ongoing work focussed on gambling businesses in Australia to fight money laundering opportunities in the gambling industry. Following the Federal Court ordering\xa0Crown pay $450 million\xa0in penalties over 2 years in 2023, this year AUSTRAC has seen the Federal Court order\xa0SkyCity to pay a $67 million penalty\xa0for breaches to the AML/CTF Act, accept an\xa0enforceable undertaking from Sportsbet,\xa0continue the\xa0Federal Court case against Star\xa0and we are continuing our regulatory focus on a number of other gambling entities across Australia.\nAdditionally, the launch of the\xa0money laundering National Risk Assessment\xa0this year highlighted the highly exposed nature and vulnerability to money laundering online betting agencies face. This valuable resource has been developed support business better understand and develop appropriate measures to mitigate their risks.\nIt is now a matter for the Federal Court of Australia to determine whether Entain contravened the Act and, if so, what orders to make.

He was extradited last month and remanded to custody.\nToday (Friday 11 April), Waugh, from Warrington, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court and admitted a range of firearms offences and a count of conspiring to inflict grievous bodily harm in which he instructed an accomplice to throw acid in a victim’s face.\nWaugh smuggled the guns to the UK where his right-hand man Robert Brazendale, 37, took possession of them and provided them to customers from various organised crime groups.\nIn February 2022, Brazendale, of Selworthy Drive, Warrington, Cheshire, was jailed for 11 years and three months (later reduced to 10 years on appeal) for transferring other firearms from the gun list. Today, he admitted new firearms offences committed with Waugh.\nWaugh, who has a previous conviction for domestic assault of a partner, plotted with gangland enforcer Jonathan Gordon, a member of Liverpool’s Deli Mob, to blind a man with acid.\nWaugh told Gordon, 37, of Kirkdale, Liverpool, and who used the EncroChat handle Valuedbridge, to “double the dose” and “cook” the intended victim with acid.\n“Just need him blind and face melted,” Waugh messaged Gordon.\nOn the day Gordon was due to carry out the attack, police patrol officers approached him in Liverpool and he ran off and the car was seized and attack prevented.\nBrazendale also admitted conspiring to inflict GBH on this victim.\nWaugh and Brazendale will return to court for sentencing on 27 June.\nThe NCA and policing partners recovered two AK47s, Uzi and Skorpion machine guns, a Grand Power automatic pistol, a Smith and Wesson pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\nBen Rutter, NCA senior investigating officer, said: “The NCA worked for five years to trace, locate and bring Philip Waugh to justice under Operation Venetic.\n“He supplied an array of terrifying automatic and semi-automatic weaponry to offenders who were planning horrific crimes.

Two cannabis farms were also found, containing a total of 150 plants.

They are known to buy such businesses using the proceeds of crime, which provides them with a legitimate income and opportunities for money laundering.\nThe crackdown, which is part of the NCA’s continued disruption of cash being laundered in the UK, involved 19 different police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units, as well as national agencies including HMRC, Trading Standards and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.\n\nIt was supported by the National Police Chiefs’ Council and coordinated by the NCA’s National Economic Crime Centre, which provided intelligence to assist local forces, as well as funding for operational activity.\nRachael Herbert, Deputy Director of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA, said:\n“Operation Machinize targeted barbershops and other high street businesses being used as cover for a whole range of criminality, all across the country.\n“We have seen links to drug trafficking and distribution, organised immigration crime, modern slavery and human trafficking, firearms, and the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes.\n“We know cash-intensive businesses are used as fronts for money laundering, facilitating some of the highest harm and highest impact offending in the UK.\n“Here at the National Economic Crime Centre, we coordinate UK-wide action, and lead cross-system efforts to make our financial system more resilient.\n“The excellent results from the first iteration of Operation Machinize are testament to the tireless work of officers across the country, and demonstrate our resolve to clamp down on organised criminality abusing the high street.”\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said:\n“High street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice.\n“This successful NCA-led operation highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face and demonstrates our collective determination to make our streets safer, a key pillar of this government’s Plan for Change.\n“We will continue to support the NCA, and other law enforcement partners, as we make the UK an even more hostile environment for organised crime.”\n10 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1744286400, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Preston man charged with assisting people smuggling kingpin', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/preston-man-charged-with-assisting-people-smuggling-kingpin', 'content': '\nA man from Preston has been charged following a National Crime Agency investigation into people smuggling.\nIranian national Anjan Ahmadi, age 26, of Stafano Road, Preston, was originally arrested in July 2024 as part of an enquiry into the activities of Amanj Hasan Zada.\nZada, also of Stefano Road, was convicted of a series of people smuggling offences in November 2024, when he was sentenced to 17 years in prison.\nThe NCA were able to link him to a series of movements of migrants into the UK from France in late 2023.\n\nInvestigators believe he is part of the global people smuggling network moving migrants from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) into the UK and Europe.

These are the first convictions for enabling a designated person.\nIn 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Dmitrii Ovsiannikov as governor of the city of Sevastopol in Crimea, a position he held until July 2019. He was sanctioned by the EU, and when the UK left the EU, the UK imposed financial sanctions under the Russia Regulations 2019.\nAlthough sanctioned, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov secured a UK passport in January 2023 by virtue of having a British father.\xa0 Dmitrii arrived in Britain on 1 February 2023, and joined his wife and two young children\xa0who were already living in his brother's house in Clapham.\nThe same month, Dmitrii Ovsiannikov applied for a bank account into which his wife transferred £76,000, allowing him to put down a deposit on a Mercedes Benz GLC 300 SUV.

Alexei Owsjanikow attended a voluntarily interview about his role in enabling sanctions evasion. Four months later, Alexei paid more than £40,000 in school fees for his brother's two youngest children, a breach of the sanctions.\nGraeme Biggar, Director General of the NCA said: “Dmitrii Ovsiannikov and his brother clearly knew that he was subject to these sanctions and deliberately took steps to circumvent the controls.\n“These convictions demonstrate not only that designated individuals are on our radar, but so are those who enable breaches of the regulations.\n“Today’s verdict is testament to the hard work and determination of the NCA’s Combatting Kleptocracy Cell, which has delivered more than 180 disruptions to remove or reduce a criminal threat posed by Putin-linked elites and their enablers since the invasion of Ukraine.”\nStephen Doughty, FCDO Sanctions Minister said:\xa0“Mr Ovsiannikov thought he could hide from our sanctions.

His messages revealed he was also a professional money launderer, managing and hiding millions of pounds he and others made from crime.”\nInvestigators found clues to Starkcake’s real-life identity in his messages, pairing these with cell site and financial data to verify it was Vaid.\nOne message to Starkcake indicated that criminal cash had been paid into the account of “H Vaid”, which investigators identified corresponded with a transaction on Vaid’s bank account. Officers also identified that Vaid made a payment at a café in Dubai around the time Starkcake told an associate he was in the country.\nInvestigators gathered cell site data that showed Vaid’s movements correlated with conversations about Starkcake’s whereabouts. In one case, data indicated Vaid was at a river near his then-home after Starkcake told an associate he was going for a riverside walk.\nInvestigators subsequently arrested Vaid at his home address in April 2024.\nThe evidence gathered by investigators was so compelling that Vaid pleaded guilty to 12 drugs and proceeds of crime charges, and a count of conspiracy to blackmail, relating to threats he made to a debtor.\nLead officer Seldon concluded: \n“Vaid attempted to fly under the radar by using an encrypted phone and getting others to do his bidding, but he underestimated the capability and tenacity of investigators.\n“By taking a pivotal person like Vaid out of the service of organised crime groups, the NCA is disrupting the supply of the most dangerous drugs in the UK and taking the profit out of ruining lives.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Man charged in NCA investigation over cocaine stash in electric wheelchair', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/man-charged-in-nca-investigation-over-cocaine-stash-in-electric-wheelchair', 'content': '\nA man has been charged with drug smuggling following a National Crime Agency investigation after nearly £1m of cocaine was found hidden in an electric wheelchair.\nCasimiro De Lemos Francisco, 56, was stopped at Manchester Airport on Sunday after he arrived on a flight from Bridgetown in Barbados.\nBorder Force officers scanned the wheelchair which contained 11 packages, weighing 12k, concealed in the seat and backrest.\nDe Lemos Francisco, a Portuguese national, was remanded today at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court and will appear next at Manchester Crown Court on 6 May.\n\nNCA senior investigating officer Charles Lee, said:\n“The concealment shows the ingenuity crime groups employ to smuggle cocaine.\n“The NCA works with partners at home and abroad to combat the threat of Class A drugs and protect the UK public.”\n1 April 2025 ', 'date_time': 1743508800, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'Operation Stovewood: Brothers jailed for 31 years for raping girls', 'url': 'https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/operation-stovewood-brothers-jailed-for-31-years-for-raping-girls', 'content': '\nTwo brothers who raped vulnerable girls 18 years ago have been jailed for 31 years, following a National Crime Agency (NCA) investigation.\nMark Evans, 37, and Robert Evans, 40, abused children in Rotherham over a two-year period starting in 2006.\nToday [28 March] at Sheffield Crown Court they were sentenced to 14 and 17 years’ imprisonment respectively for their crimes.\nThe men, aged 18 and 21 around the time, intimidated girls and plied them with drugs and alcohol before luring them to locations where they attacked them.\nThe brothers were arrested in August 2020 after officers from the NCA’s Operation Stovewood, examining historic sexual abuse in Rotherham, investigated allegations made by three victims.Specially-trained NCA officers spoke with the women after identifying they were potentially victims.\nTwo of the women subsequently told specialist investigators they were raped by both brothers.\nOne of them was 13 at the time. She was given alcohol by Mark Evans before she and some friends accompanied him to a disused barn. He then separated her from her friends and raped her.The same woman was attacked by Robert Evans several months later, when he lured the girl to a house in Rotherham by lying that one of her friends would be there.\n\nPictured:\xa0Mark Evans (L) and Robert Evans (R)\nRobert Evans plied her with alcohol as they took a bus to the house. Once Evans had the victim alone at the house, he raped her. She recalled he seemed amused by this.\nAnother woman related how she too was raped by both brothers when she was 14. She knew the men because they spent time with other girls her age.She recounted how Mark Evans walked her home one evening because it was dark, but as they passed through an alleyway he raped her.\nShe and the first victim were later lured by Robert Evans to a house, on a separate occasion to when the first victim was attacked by him. At the house, Robert Evans forced the second girl into a bathroom and raped her.\nThe third victim was age 13 when Mark Evans began grooming her by giving her alcohol and drugs, and calling her his “girlfriend”. The victim told officers how Mark Evans visited her at her home and asked her for sex. Fearing Evans would dump her, the girl complied with his request, and he took her into an alleyway where he had sex with her.\nThese were just some of the sexual offences committed against the girls which the men denied when NCA investigators arrested them.\nHowever, following a two-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court the brothers were found guilty of a number of sexual offences, including rape, on 4 December 2024.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, NCA Senior Investigator Kim Boreham said: “I would like to recognise the courage and strength of the three victims in this case. For almost twenty years these women have suffered the profound consequences of Mark and Robert Evans’ crimes, while the two men continued their lives as normal.\n“These brave women have been determined to receive justice and the National Crime Agency has matched their resolve, ensuring the Evans brothers have been held to account.“I hope the victims will find some peace in knowing their attackers are no longer living free today.\n“I encourage anyone who was sexually abused as a child, no matter how long ago, to report it to police. Every victim deserves justice.”\nSamantha Thompson, Specialist Prosecutor, of the Crown Prosecution Service said: “The Evans brothers targeted and groomed young girls including with alcohol and drugs,\xa0for child sexual abuse and rape.\n“The lifelong physical and emotional trauma caused to victims by men like the Evans brothers cannot be understated. This type of conduct has equally damaged the community confidence of Rotherham. \xa0\n“We would like to thank the victims\xa0in this case for coming forward and reporting this devastating crime. I hope this conviction sends a clear message that the CPS will continue to relentlessly pursue justice and prosecute those who sexually exploit children, whenever that abuse took place.\n“I encourage any victims of child sexual abuse and sexual violence to report the crimes committed against them to the police. You are not alone and there is always help available.”\nAdults can report sexual abuse suffered as a child by calling police on 101, or reporting it in person at a police station.

NCA analysts estimate that thousands of users – offenders and victims – based in the UK and other western countries have exchanged millions of messages online relating to sexual and physical abuse.\nAlthough adults are involved in these online communities, of particular concern is that offenders are predominantly teenage boys that often share sadistic and misogynistic material, and have been seen to target those their own age or younger.\nOffenders include a new generation of young, English-speaking cyber criminals who work together to execute data breaches and commit fraud, launch malware or ransomware attacks, and use social engineering and grooming techniques on victims.\nThe NCA and UK law enforcement have identified a number of cases in which girls, some as young as 11, have been coerced into seriously harming or sexually abusing themselves, siblings or pets.\nIn some instances, victims have been groomed into offending themselves.\nNCA Director General Graeme Biggar said:\n“This is a hugely complex and deeply concerning phenomenon. Young people are being drawn into these sadistic and violent online gangs where they are collaborating at scale to inflict, or incite others to commit, serious harm.\n“These groups are not lurking on the dark web, they exist in the same online world and platforms young people use on a daily basis. It is especially concerning to see the impact this is having on young girls who are often groomed into hurting themselves and in some cases, even encouraged to attempt suicide.\n“The NCA is coordinating UK law enforcement’s response to this emerging threat. We are collaborating with policing, tech companies, safeguarding agencies and psychologists to better understand how young people become offenders and safeguard victims.\n“Operating online clearly makes these offenders feel protected and out of reach but that is absolutely not the case. There have already been convictions, we and partners have made arrests in the UK and overseas, and further investigations are ongoing.\n“I’d encourage parents and carers to have regular conversations with their child about what they do online, and ensure they know they have your support should they need it.”\nThe online landscape of these networks is vast, with many groups having a different focus such as cybercrime or inflicting physical harm. However, membership is loose and fluid which leads to the range of different criminality being committed by individual offenders.\nLast month following an NCA investigation, Richard Ehiemere was convicted of fraud and indecent images of children (IIOC) offences, committed when he was just 17 and linked to a prolific online harms group.\nIn January, 19-year-old Cameron Finnigan was jailed for assisting suicide, possession of IIOC, a terror offence, and criminal damage, following an investigation by Counter Terror Policing South East (CTPSE).\nEvidence suggests that offenders are motivated by gaining notoriety and status, which can be achieved based on the harm they inflict and the depravity of the content they share. These networks share content relating to a broad and diverse range of extreme belief systems that they use to justify violence.\nSexual gratification can also be a motivating factor and in some cases, offenders are finding opportunities to profit from their criminality directly, or by selling material to others. The NCA is engaging with experts and academics to improve our understanding of motivations of offenders in this area and what can be done to deter them.\nAlso common across networks is the use of coercion and extortion tactics. Offenders manipulate victims by grooming them, or convincing them that they are in a relationship. As with other types of grooming, this leads to victims not recognising themselves as such, or being too scared to come forward, which likely contributes to the underreporting of this offending.\nJess Phillips, Minister for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, said:\n“The scale of child sexual abuse in this report is absolutely horrific and drives home the need for a co-ordinated response to tackle this global issue.\n“We have seen the heartbreaking impact of crimes such as grooming and sextortion on victims around the world—many of them children who have been blackmailed and manipulated into sharing images of themselves, which has devastatingly led to some children taking their own lives.\n“This is why this government is using every lever at our disposal to make the UK a safer place for children online, including implementation of the Online Safety Act which has some of the strongest laws in the world to protect children.\n“My message to parents is to have open conversations with your children and to seek support if you are concerned about child sexual abuse.\n“My message to tech companies is simple: this is your responsibility too. You must ensure your platforms are safe for children, so that we can protect the most vulnerable and put predators behind bars.”\nAssistant Chief Constable Alastair Simpson, national policing lead for Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse & Undercover Online, said:\n“The growth of Com networks that incite and encourage children and vulnerable adults towards acts of self-harm, suicide and violence are hugely concerning.\n“The role of undercover online officers is vital in this space, and my message to anyone who is exploiting children online: remember that there is no space where criminals operate that we cannot go, and investigations into these networks have already begun.\n“Policing will always play its part, but social media providers have a clear role to play in monitoring and regulating their platforms to root out this abhorrent criminal behaviour and make all online spaces safe for children and adults.\n“I would encourage anyone who has been a victim of this type of crime to report it to police, you will be met with empathy and respect, and there are organisations that can support you.”\nChildren and young people are better protected when they have adults around them who they feel they can trust, talk to and won’t be blamed by.

This could be a real photo taken by the victim, or a fake image created of them by the offender.\nNCA-commissioned research conducted prior to the campaign\'s launch showed that 74% of boys questioned did not fully understand what sextortion was, the same proportion\xa0didn\'t see requests for nude images as a warning sign or attempt of \'sextortion\',\xa073% were not aware of how to report incidents and only 12% admitted they may be at risk of \'sextortion\'.\n\'Sextortion\' can be perpetrated by organised crime groups based overseas, predominantly in some West African countries, but also South East Asia.\nThey are motivated by making money quickly, rather than by sexual gratification, and in some cases have gone from initial contact to blackmailing their victim in under an hour.\nAll age groups and genders have been targeted, but the month-long\xa0campaign is aimed at boys aged between 15 and 17.\nThe NCA\'s\xa0CEOP Safety Centre received 380 reports of \'sextortion\' in 2024 and in the first five months of 2024, police forces received an average of 117 reports of \'sextortion\' from under 18\'s each month. However, offences related to Child Sexual Abuse are generally underreported and the actual figure is likely to be higher.\nIn the year to June 2024, the US National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) received an average of 556 reports of \'sextortion\' per week, amounting to over 28,000 global cases per year – up from 26,718 the previous year.\nThe campaign follows an unprecedented alert issued by the NCA in April last year to teachers across the UK, which reached an estimated 320,000 - 365,000 people or roughly two thirds of all teaching staff.\nThese professionals reported that the alert had helped them recognise \'sextortion\', and made them better prepared if they should encounter any cases of it.\nAlongside this new campaign for teenage boys, the NCA is also issuing guidance for parents and carers on how to support their child if they become a victim.

As the National Lead Force for fraud, we have a responsibility to deliver impactful results across the UK, and we can't thank all the participating forces enough for their hard work and dedication throughout Henhouse 4.\n“Fraud can take many vindictive and harmful forms, but through the combined efforts of forces up and down the country, including those at the City of London Police, we can make a real difference in stopping criminals in their tracks. With over £7.5m seized and 433 arrests made during Henhouse 4, we will look to build on this success throughout the rest of 2025.”\nMinister for Fraud Lord Hanson said:\n“Fraud is a truly terrible crime which takes many forms and can affect anyone. We are determined to meet the scale of the issue head-on.\n“The ongoing success of Operation Henhouse demonstrates the excellence of police and law enforcement partners, and the real-world impact of their activity to crack down on this truly pernicious crime. We will continue to work closely with them to highlight the importance of the Stop! Think Fraud campaign, and to introduce a new expanded Fraud Strategy, as part of our Plan for Change.”\nThe public can take steps to help protect themselves. It is essential that they continue to report fraud to Action Fraud, and follow advice found on the Stop! Think Fraud website. Every report helps the NCA and policing identify and support victims, prevent future fraud, repatriate losses, and target the criminals, wherever they are.\n19 March 2025 ", 'date_time': 1742385600, 'source_id': 'ZtQPFpYBWUzV57vGJyqG', 'source_name': 'nationalcrimeagency', 'read': False}, {'title': 'The 39th MENAFATF Plenary and Working Group Meetings', 'url': '2661', 'content': 'The 39th Plenary of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) concluded in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which was held from November 16 to 21, 2024.
